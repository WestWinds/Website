            <pre>
            My teeth become dust, 
            Biting back the words

            That crawl up my throat,
            With the intent,
            To destroy.
            I swallow
            It all back;
            The taste of metal in my 
            Mouth.

            And ironically enough,
            “I love you”
            Was the sweetest.

            <div class="title">That Feeling</div>
            <div class="author">By: Amanda Carrasco</div>

            <pre>
            I am beautiful because you made me this way,
            Your love and laughter filled me up 
            And put a smile on my face.
            Those glowing brown eyes
            Gave me confidence,
            But suddenly, the beauty faded away.

            You took it with you the moment you left
            Your love was no longer mine
            To hold, to have, to keep.
            The gleam in your eyes no longer there.

            With you, you took the beauty you gave me,
            Soon to be someone else’s.
            I only wish the beauty within you
            Doesn’t die out.
            I only wish you stay beautiful.

                        My teeth become dust, 
                        Biting back the words

                        That crawl up my throat,
                        With the intent,
                        To destroy.
                        I swallow
                        It all back;
                        The taste of metal in my 
                        Mouth.

                        And ironically enough,
                        “I love you”
                        Was the sweetest.

                        <pre>
                        I am beautiful because you made me this way,
                        Your love and laughter filled me up 
                        And put a smile on my face.
                        Those glowing brown eyes
                        Gave me confidence,
                        But suddenly, the beauty faded away.

                        You took it with you the moment you left
                        Your love was no longer mine
                        To hold, to have, to keep.
                        The gleam in your eyes no longer there.

                        With you, you took the beauty you gave me,
                        Soon to be someone else’s.
                        I only wish the beauty within you
                        Doesn’t die out.
                        I only wish you stay beautiful.

                <pre>
                My teeth become dust, 
                Biting back the words

                That crawl up my throat,
                With the intent,
                To destroy.
                I swallow
                It all back;
                The taste of metal in my 
                Mouth.

                And ironically enough,
                “I love you”
                Was the sweetest.

                <pre>
                I am beautiful because you made me this way,
                Your love and laughter filled me up 
                And put a smile on my face.
                Those glowing brown eyes
                Gave me confidence,
                But suddenly, the beauty faded away.

                You took it with you the moment you left
                Your love was no longer mine
                To hold, to have, to keep.
                The gleam in your eyes no longer there.

                With you, you took the beauty you gave me,
                Soon to be someone else’s.
                I only wish the beauty within you
                Doesn’t die out.
                I only wish you stay beautiful.

                <pre>
                Pen in hand, you stare at the paper,
                "Dear Mom and Dad," you say in a whisper
                You sigh and rip the paper up,
                Nothing you write is good enough.
                You slowly lay on the bed,
                "Goodbye," you say in your head
                You calm now and go to sleep,
                Never to awake to those who weep.
                This selfish solution you chose in the end,
                Made many hearts impossible to mend.


                Dedicated to Amanda Todd and all who have also thought that suicide was the answer to their problems.
                May you rest in paradise.

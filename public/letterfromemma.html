Dearest Reader,
 I have wanted to be a part of this magazine since I heard about it my freshman year. I love this 
magazine like a child, and this edition is like a child to me. My staff, those wonderful people who spent every Tuesday afternoon listening to me anxiously talk about all of the things we needed to get done and those who were willing and able to do what I asked even if they could not make it to meetings, are like family to me, and I cannot stress enough their importance. These letters from the Editor-In-Chief always seem to make of myself and those I am following the lone savior of the magazine, the Atlas of West Winds, all important and the only one worth hearing from, and truth be told, I am rather insignificant when compared to my staff.

 Creating this publication was no easy feat, and over the course of the year we faced many pitfalls and hardships, from things as trivial as misunderstandings of school policy to the death of a staff member, a travesty not even I, with three years of planning, knew how to deal with. The work was hard, the nights were long and the heartache was unbearable when something went wrong, but we did it, and I am proud not only of what you hold in your hands, but of those who helped make it possible.

 I chose the theme of "Legacies" to celebrate the 100th progressed, it became the perfect descriptor for what we, as a staff, aimed to do. A legacy is a link from the past to the present and into the future; it is our past and our path forward. I was drawn to West Winds because it is an exercise in preservation, it gives a voice to the students who might otherwise not have a voice, and it allows future generations to walk the halls of West High as we did.

 It has been an honor to serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the centennial edition. It has been an honor to head the best staff I could have ever asked for, to join a legacy of past editors, and to make something beautiful. It was no easy task, it does not come without heartbreak, mishap and frustration, it is not accomplished without sleepless nights, long hours in front a computer screen, a few tears, and at least one thing going wrong, but the difficulties only serve to make the honor mores prevalent and worthwhile. I hope to leave in my wake a legacy, one to join the greater tradition of West High School publication, a step in a new, hopefully right, direction. Most of all I hope I, and my staff, have created something that you, dear reader, can enjoy for years to come.

With love,

Emma Eleanor Metos, Editor-in-Chief 2014

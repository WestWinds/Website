What have you done?
Why would you hide instead on dance in the sun?
You stand in the shade and over-think it all,
Never quite realizing how that will make you fall.
Because life is meant to be live out loud,
Not hiding underneath some dark and foreboding cloud.
Nor is it meant to be captured and held in the dark,
Because life is not one,
But a million sparks.
So go stand in the shadows,
If you must, and take it in. 
Because I will be over here
Throwing caution to the wind,
Just waiting for you to catch on,
And join in on my fun,
So we can dance,
While reveling in the magic we've spun,
Me kissing you soundly and
 Giving you a knowing look,
You looking at me sheepishly, realizing how long it took.
Us, bursting into silly grins, while standing in the sun,
Because coming home is exactly what you've done.

Sadly everything's fixated, 
It's sad how I'm always faded
Everything's over rated, darkly tainted
And coldly hated.
So tell me how we are to live
When our world is dark
When humanity has left it's cold
Unbearable mark
You can't even see a spark.
The world's unstable
Earth's no longer able
To hold life

Take a friend, with a camera
Add an impulsive teenage brain
Wait 10 years
And no-one sees you.
They see the impulsive past.

And opinions change to weights
That each person drops on your 
Life, carefully constructed of glass
Until it shatters.

And you can see the
Still-impulsive past in each
Sharp edge.

The dawn in coming
Night's end is nigh
The light is streaking
Across the sky
And when it reaches
My tear soaked eye
The dark, black place
Inside me dies.
The fleeting darkness
Not fast retreats
The sorrow's lifted
My weeping ceased
Another chapter
Is firmly creased
No longer strapped and tucked away
But revealed, resolved
Under light of day.
This truly is a brand new day

They tell me to just walk away

Instead I run
Harsh footfalls pounding a panicked rhythm into rough cement
Icy wind scratching at my face and clawing my eyes
A wild roar that washes away even the frantic intake of my lungs

Only in the loudest part of the storm
Can I hear over your unspeaking glances
And though I am the one running
It is the still air that like a cyclone
Carries away your stares and my heartbeat

Replacing them with tingling extremities and 
Winter silence

My mind is sea-green cool
Having bled my anxiety onto the pavement
In red footsteps
You do not see

When you walk in the loud-quiet of a Monday morning
The rough stones of fourth west are invisible
Only to me are they crimson-stained

Invisibly etched with a deafeningly quiet drumbeat

Missing you and the sound of your voice
Hate not seeing you, but I got no choice
You're alive, but it's almost like you're not
Sad to say, Mom's all I got

Hate seeing you lay in that bed
Watching people without a word said
Do you remember me? It's your daughter
You can't read, but listen to this letter

I miss you Daddy, it's been a year or two
Since that accident that got you blue
Are you coming back? Come back home? 
Without you here, we feel all alone

We need you, to complete our family
I'll take care of you, as long as you're here
I love you, I'll always be your little girl
Like you said, me and you

Against the world

I'm a little lost, a little confused
I've lost my mommy's hand at the store
I'm a little shaken, a little bruised
I just want one band-aid more
I'm a little bit cold, a little bit hurt
and I think I've got too many dents
I'm a little irreparable, a little too broken
I'm ready to burn my own fingerprints

Bloodshot eyes and smeared make-up
A forced smile and chapped lips
Pink fingernails clutch a bottle
Her mind's in the clouds
Her feet struggle to stay on the ground
She wants to fly away now
From the stress, pressure, failure.
She wants to feel free now
From the judgment, insecurities, loneliness
She's reached the moon now
She's weightless with no problems holding her down
Yet the craters of the moon are an unfamiliar place
And she feels just as lost as before
She's falling now
She's in an endless pit
A black abyss
She's captured by a camera now
With her bloodshot eyes, smeared makeup
Forced smile, chapped lips
Pink fingernails, Smirnoff bottle
And the picture is saying a thousand unsaid words.

Araceli Haslam
It's hiding,
Between songs of affection.
Poems with their being rooted,
And blooming through words.
It's captured,
When he looks at her
And his eyes light up
And his heart races.
It's exposed,
In the moments
You're unaware of
How lovely you look.

To make eye contact
In a crowded place
And not be able to look away.

To have endless 
Conversations, and
Not be awake alone 
In the lonely A.M. hours

To intertwine fingers
While taking walks
In gloomy weather
With cups of tea

To be clich&eacute;
And choosing a 
Song to be
&ldquo;our song&rdquo;

To wrestle, to play
To feel safe, to feel loved
To be two, instead of one

I desire to be desired.

The airplane settles on the ocean floor,
Full of air pockets
Of the recycled breaths I brought with me.
My carry on; a piece of the desert,
Where each breath of air is as thin
As a playing card split in half.

I step into the tunnel,
Decks of cards in my pockets, 
And water is spilling in through the cracks.
And those playing cards made of recycled breaths
Melt in my mouth.

There's a trade paperback in my purse;
I never really did like those.
They're cheap and usually emblazoned with 
Big name authors who don't deserve their titles

But that's okay because
Soon I will be breathing air as thick as 
The glossy pages of books printed in Europe.
This is the place I used to talk about
So much about how the air, just the air
Had gold edges.
How since I had left this place, home, I couldn't quite breathe,
That the smog was too thick in the valley
I migrated to.

I get off the plane and take a deep breath,
But it's all water.
The air isn't a well-printed book anymore;
It's enough salt to corrode leather
And melt ink off of pages.
It isn't the same;
The book I had grown up in is dog-eared
Spine broken,
Coffee stained
And overdue.

And I love books
With a steaming cup of tea:
Twinnings Earl Grey, English Breakfast
Zhena's roses, the hips I ordered from ebay,
Fleece blankets just for sick days
And the pillow I had wanted for years in the clearance section
Of a department store when I was a staring child.

Yes, I love books, but I cannot spend my life reading
The same one over again,
When I've read something greater.

If I am to dig graves for the rest of my life
I wish to do it with my hair long and proud,
Swinging at the small of my back as a testament of
Will in the face of adversity,
Grown by the fruits of my labor.
I want to harvest the nectar
From the pear tree on my horizon
And when I eat my fill,
I will just as easily leave the sweetness behind,
Before it spoils and then,
I will look the hurricane in the eye and laugh,
Because I know it will baptize the earth
And my pear tree will be waiting for the day
This nomad returns to her roots.
 
If I am to choose between
A false lover and Uncertainty in the North
I want to have the gall to say,
&ldquo;Brother, come at eight.&rdquo;
I want to have the self-control
To lower the gun on a man,
Whose mind is a dank closet full of spiders.
By then, I must be ready to venture out,
And risk this Uncertainty in the North.
 
If I am to take my revenge,
I wish to do so without collateral damage,
And if I do,
I want everyone to learn that revenge
Will stab you with your own rapier
And that I am the kind of person,
Who will make you drink your own wine,
Because, in the end,
We are all sinners.
 
If I am to write propaganda to support
A nauseating turn of society,
I would rather be exiled.
Iceland, Siberia, The Ministry of Love:
They are all the same,
Because I will come out a different person
For better or for worse.
 
I wish to have the strength to cut my hair
Because I will not hesitate
To cut ties with anyone,
Who stands in the way of my passion.
I must be unorthodox
If I see my fellow men
Following in each other's footsteps, with their eyes closed.
I will scream it in the streets,
&ldquo;The world is not pretty.&rdquo;
 
If I am to be unorthodox,
I wish to have faith,
Strong enough not to be undone by mere chance,
Strong enough so I can watch the coin fall:
Heads.
Heads.
Heads.
Accepting that I will one day die.
And if it involves a ship,
I will be its captain.

They are mind children,
These intellectual infants.

Born of coveted moments,
Gripped so hard my nails leave
Bloody moon slivers
As I try to hold onto happiness.
Distraught, as it
Darts between my piano fingers.

They are also born of histories
That leave my knees weak,
To the point I simply collapse and weep
Desolate cries that draw only predators.
And my demons come at night
To take tastes out of my flesh.
And I stare.
Wide-eyed,
As I am devoured. 

Infatuations become mercy kills.
I tie my own hands and
Blindfold my eyes for execution,
So that I do not rip out my heart
For short lived pleasure.

Love is an elusive trickster anyway.

These emotions are,
Heaving and surging.
Beasts beating their heads against walls,
Heavy chains bestowed upon them.
Broken teeth clatter across stone floors.
Clamor as the iron moans.

All this beneath my heated skin.
Chaos is trapped in this body.
It is discord.
This temptation of the sirens,
Primal illusions revealing themselves
In my dreams.
Smoky eyes that blink and are gone.

They are the whispers that visit me
At the loneliest hours.
Cold fingers grazing my cheek
In an unnerving gesture,
Spawned by my own fantasies.
Voices that echo of nostalgia,
Lovers I will never know.

There are lost souls inside of me.
Beating their fists.
Migraines, blood pulsing in my temples,
They want out!

To feel humanity with their own starved bodies,
They want out!

They are hungry!
Hungry,
To create beauty.
Begging, praying
To become something beautiful,
At last!

Let them out!
Let them out!

My children.

Storm clouds hang low;

The bellowing Gods,
Whose breaths shape monuments,
Whose howls scatter blackbirds,

Whose sorrow carves the canyons.

Their emotions hang on the changing winds.
Their fleeting whims engraved in their sunset stones.

Tormenting the weary traveler with raw life,
In a land where outlaws chase their shadows.

Now is not a time for frivolous, trivial journals
About days and hours and minutes
And the events they have touched,
The things boiling, lively
Within them.

This is not a journal for things,
Short-lived sighs of our material world;
The rushing, rushing by of life,
But without the nostalgia of a train
Ride separating lovers 
Two toiling tracks at a time–
Bolt– Track

Or, even the allure of a subway car, 
Gliding through its veins beneath 
Tarred skin, glass hair and satellite eyes.

The train disappears, 
Growling itself to sleep in its tunnels,
Leaving the body on the tracks,
Few feet shy of the
Commandment line screaming, begging
You, &ldquo;DO NOT CROSS&rdquo;

Yes, you've got it now,
The experience, the things must be made,
Forged by the broken and bruised hands
Of the damned and the lost into thoughts
So that the body swept away and coddled in the man-made night
May learn,

Even if infinity has passed,
It cannot be too late or the saints would be out of a job and
The earth drained
Of all redemption.

It's been a year.
A year since I held your hand
Kissed your lips
Whispered in your ear
It's been over a year.

A year since we SCREAMED
Since YOU left me.
Since YOU cheated me.
Since YOU scorned me.
It's been nothing but a year

So we SPLIT
Over the course of 2 minutes,
 WE were no more
WE were nothing
It's been a long year.

SO WHY when I see you.
Holding HIS hand 
Laughing at HIS joke
Kissing HIS lips
Why does MY heart ache?

Why does the wall,
The one that I made,
That I carved of Brimstone and Coated in Ice 
Why does it CRACK, showing the heart I keep inside?
The blackened and pale ghost I keep silent
WHY DOES IT HURT
Why does my heart still bleed? 
Why, just…. 
Why?
It's been nothing but a long year.

I am a fool.
I had been warned, but I ignored it.
I was given a gift, and I abused it.
My pride has, quite literally, burned me.
I was given wings, feathers of bronze
Held together with wax and willpower.
My father had said—&ldquo;don't leave&rdquo;
My tutor had said—&ldquo;don't try&rdquo;
Daedalus said—&ldquo;don't fly too high&rdquo;
But I, in my pride, ignored them.
When I began I felt the euphoria, the
Joy of flight, and in my joy, my pride.

I flew too high.

And I fell.

The wings fell apart in the sun,
The wax-burns drifted down my back,
Burning flesh as I fell, the ocean greeted
Me, and those wings that had lifted me up, now dragged me down.

Now I, Icarus, sit in my watery grave
Contemplating the folly of flight.
Remember the joy of falling.

With the summer rays
in the mountain air
came hope and love.
Alive and glorious
they were,
possessing us with such
happiness and optimism.
And with the warmth,
our love stayed firm. 
The first chilly breeze
was such a shock!
It sent us into shivers.
We clung to each other,
searching for the warmth
that was so fervent
not so long ago.
Eventually, we found it
again, in a different way
and suddenly the nights were
busy and the days long.
Then the snow covered the 
ground in an abrupt carpet.
With the snow came 
unexpected news:
from our love, we now had
life. 
And with the snow and 
the unexpected news,
came a rock on a ring
with a hesitant promise.
The roses bloomed, 
such a bright red!
And one night, 
so did the bed sheets
under me…
So red was our bed,
and the pain so bright.
And though the flowers bloomed,
so gorgeously,
ours did not. 
And with our blossom withered, 
the promise and the rock
followed shortly after
and everything was gone
on a swift cool breeze. 
So, with the warmth of summer
now returning, 
my hope and my love
does not.

Last year when someone told me they could hear my voice from the other room
I'd shrink inside, draw my arms close to my body, shut my mouth
And attempt to disappear into the comforting haze of others conversation 
Let the boys tell the loud jokes

I'm done with that

I'm tired of blending in
        Just to fit a set of preordained constraints imposed on me by a dead patriarchy 
And if you can hear me talk from the next room 
          Then maybe you can call yourself lucky

So call me cocky
Just don't call me small

Last year when someone told me to pluck my eyebrows or tie back my hair
I'd blush like somehow it was my fault
Tell them I'd do it for tomorrow
Because somehow the condescension with which they informed me of my shortcomings 
Had convinced me that they mattered

Well I'm done with that too

Because I'm tired of blending in
I will not be the chameleon so set on becoming its background it can't find itself in a mirror
I'd rather be a swallowtail, It's bright colors screaming poison
The colors jarring against muted greens and grays
But beautiful under the deep blue sky of a summer day

I'd rather be dangerous
Than nondescript 

Last year when someone told me "modern art" was worthless
Or poetry should rhyme
I'd set my lips in a line and keep quiet
It's not like I could change their mind anyway

I'm done with that too

I will not blend in
I will not be the sculpture the artist chips away at until it becomes nothing but shavings of clay to be swept into the garbage Wednesday evening
Id rather be the unfinished block of marble with only a hand escaping from its unsettling immensity
Beautiful despite the roughness of the finish

My heart remembers crushed tulip petals and the smell of baguettes

Or so I'd like to think
But in the harsh light of day, that tiny girl with mousy bob
Trapped in brown orange album, third from the left
Is only familiar through the Kodak filter of old photos
The woman whose arms she struggles from,
Merely a stranger with my mother's face

The bright triangle of a yellow dress
I don't recall
          Was it wool
          An uncomfortable intrusion into a candy colored world of pink flesh and green grass?
          Or crafted of soft cotton, miraculously smooth
I've forgotten

The dampness of the air

I misremember the color of the flowers, 
         And the scent of fresh baked bread has slipped my mind.

In science class my teacher says
That if you took all your DNA
And stretched it in a long thin line
It would reach to the moon and back
Six Times
Well, I can't see the moon from here
A dry tank containing both gravel
And the tragic suggestion of dead fish
Leans against gray faux-brick walls
Under a lead fume hood
Rusted scalpels tint my vision red
No, I can't see the moon from here.
Next day, when the sun rises
It too is red
I stand on the grass, wet beneath my feet
The crickets don't mention DNA
In their sharp morning song
But I can see the moon.

I always feel so lonely
Even if I'm not alone.

My dad always watches TV,
He never diverts his eyes,
Even if I'm dancing
He's never looked at me.

I always feel so lonely, 
Even if I'm not alone.

My sister is always chatting,
With her friends for away.
She hasn't ever talked to me
Even if it's mocking.

I always feel so lonely,
Even if I'm not alone.

My mom is always with me,
Or at least that's what I'm told.
Even if she's really here,
There is no hand to hold.

When I close my eyes, there is a vast space.
My gut balloons and I am filled with longing.
An unexpected darkness
Full of unknown futures
That beckons to my heart.
But I am grounded
And stay still.

When I see mountains,
Their unending and free profiles,
I walk in their golden grass,
But only in spirit.
And I am grounded,
And I stay still.

79th Battalion, 12th Division
Ozzie Beam.
I remember the name
Because I thought it was funny.
It isn't though because that name
Only lived 32 years
And now it's dead
On stone.
 
The leaves fall like paratroopers
With no control but the wind
And the tombs are lined for battle
Identical in looks. Identical in fates.
The air is weighed down by silence
Like the world took a breath
And its lungs are screaming for air
But no breath can come.
 
Perched on top of a marble column
Sits a cardinal surveying his troops
And despite the beauty of his red breast
I still shoot
But he flies away before the
Camera can capture him.
 
The loud birds are screeching
Yelling angrily
To drown out the silent voices of death  
Screeching to try and ignore the faces
Staring lifelessly up at them
Faces of soldiers
Known but to God
Who had stories of their own
 And lives and lovers of their own
 
That we will never know
Because those secrets
Died on their tongues before they could be spoken
And now they are buried in the ground
Still perched on the young boys lips
Waiting for someone to ask
So the secrets can grow
Through the earth like flowers
And bloom for us to pick.
If only the ground could speak
Oh, the stories you could tell.
Oh, the stories we can't hear.

Emily is so lucky
Lucky little Emily
Got two parents that love her and each other
Others aren't so lucky
No
Be happy, lucky little Emily
Others have it worse
Divorce tears families apart
Don't you know
Emily
So lucky that you don't see behind the magician's trick
You don't see what goes on behind the curtain

Lucky little Emily
Doesn't know
Doesn't see that daddy isn't there
Doesn't see daddy lose his temper
No
Emily is daddy's girl
They are so much alike
Blonde hair
Brown eyes
Eyes that are covered like playing hide and seek
But instead of counting up
She's counting down to uncover her big brown eyes
And see that she doesn't like the real daddy at all

A poison is something that harms you
So is anything that harms you a poison?
A bottle, a needle, a powder or something new
When you are infected, the race is like a death-run
 
A mortal disease filling your body with toxins and trash
Yellowing skin, blackening teeth, bloodshot eyes
Insanity will claw through your mind and make it crash
Once you are infected, you'll never be the same, filled with lies

Born within you an animal of lust and craving
He writhes when deprived of that which soothes his pain
Perhaps you will become a walker of raving
He drags himself up your throat and becomes your bane

His name is Addiction and he's a strong little entity
He is your demon, your dark shoulder angel, your worst desires
He may be strong, but you must develop some enmity 
You must hold your ground and push him back or he'll tie you with steel wires

Arsenic or alcohol, heroin or weed
Any drug or any poison becomes a massive demon, lurking in your body
They turn from a taste to an unquenchable need
You can turn from a prospective somebody, to an addicted nobody

What's your Arsenic?

Flowers of ruby, jade and sapphire dot the emerald grass
Brilliant trees of emerald leaves tableau a crystal pass
Opal River of lavender pearls whistles through the wood
A bird with bejeweled eyes and a neon plume dances as only he could
Indigo skies and pearl clouds fill the painted atmosphere
Songs of tunes no man has made can be heard from here
Fruit of sweetest taste and hue weigh the branches down
Tiara of silver, gold and bronze, placed upon the crown
Sunlight, gold as nothing else, shimmers as if a gem
Moonlight glitters like silver an opposite of them
A mountain scape of gray and mauve reaching towards the sky
Finds no purchase on the wind as it rushes by
Wind of sweeter music still, ringing through all ears
Causes hearts to soften down and eyes to fill with tears
As the sky begins to gray and night begins to fall
A pang of sadness fills my mind at the thought of leaving all
This is a fantasy, a world inside my mind
Who knew something so make believe, could make reality so blind?

Ornate décor or ghastly pallor
Revolving eyes find and gather
Every face distorted and blown
Every facet of truth has flown
Brilliant violets, blues and reds
Yellow feathers atop the heads
No face is seen beneath the mask
No smiling face can fail the task
Becoming a creature of a nature not known
Another identity that you now own
A delicate face or a monster's glare
A lover's dream or a nightmare's lair
Orange flaunts the ribbon and gossamer
Black and crimson cause a horrid murmur
Green is flying across the room in a bold face
White falls over and stains its precious lace
You can fool anyone who thought they knew you
You can get anyone who thought they wanted you
My mask is not something that can be removed
My mask is a shield to which I am behooved

Though enemies their families may be,
Their love sets them apart in every way,
They force their kinfolk and the prince to see,
That sacrifice can end that bloody day.

Though their fiery passion is their flaw,
Which leads them to their deaths and undone love,
To clamp down that which is Death's own last jaw,
To fill the land with peace-wind from winged dove.

With live that lasted only a few years,
They changed more than one heart or state of mind,
They filled both mothers' eyes with tears,
They filled both fathers' hearts with love to bind. 

We know the extremes with which they performed.
Did cause the land to become one reformed.

I used to be a white wall,
pure and unblemished
but as strangers walked by
sliding their sticky filthy limbs
against my surface
I became marked and muddy
The first filthy hand left
a hole so deep on my sensitive surface
that was impossible to patch
The other filthy hands left
scratches in the middle of my surface, a place you'd call a heart
To repaint myself was easy
for they're just more scratches and dirt
but to cover that single hole that was deeper than the deepest of tunnels
would take more than just paint
And then I saw you so clearly
through my fogged point of view
My body grew sluggish as I
juggled thoughts of you
The familiar stranger whose
eyes filled that hole
not with wood nor cement nor mud
but instead his eyes filled
that hole with star dusts
and hints of crystals, diamonds, and forevers
on my surface he painted the night sky with his soft tender yet muscular limbs
Making the moon kiss every single star

You asked me if I'm agonized...
You wonder if the thought of you vanishing
From my barren life would leave a breach
In my crystal nature
 
What you don't seem to fathom
Is that your presence in my life was as relevant
As television is to animals
Your presence may be significant to others
But to me….its void
 
Your mission is to install love into my crystal nature
Which was programmed to destroy anything
That presented a sign of love
And right now…the look on your face
Gives me joy and the pain in your heart nurtures my nature
 
Don't blame me for my wicked ways…blame your kind…
And don't you ever try to save me from myself
Because next time...you will be left with more than
Just a broken heart

I will be at your side
When you're down on all hopes,
And you're at the verge of giving in
Sinking low and drowning
I will be at your side
When life seems pointless
And you run out on reasons to strive
Remember me, Remember my tear stained face
And imagine me alone in this place
Surrounded by frenemies, enemies and tragedies
Imagine the impact of your absence
On my soul, consumed by darkness
I will no longer be whole
We've been on our knees for so long
Sending prayerful pleas to the man above
To show us mercy
So when you're down on hopes
And you're at the verge of give in
Just hang on a little longer
Be a little stronger for me
And remember,
I will always be at your side.

What is a companion? 

Could it be someone who cares for you through life's chaos and contusions? 
Could it be someone who is concerned when you can't act complete? 
Could it be someone who is convivial when you are confounded, commands when you condone? 

Is it a comrade to be confused with, to be content with, to contemplate the cosmos with? 
Is it a confidante, to confide consternation in, to collect counsel from? 
Is it a conjurer of comic relief, combating catastrophe with cacophonous humor? 

Could they carry you through calamity? 
Could they confront conflict with you, constant at your side? 
Could they console you when you are caught and controlled and convulsed by misery? 

A companion could contain all these qualities!
Or, by contrast, none.

I open up my eyes to lights scattering the darkness
There is music playing in my ears
Thank God I can't hear how loud my heartbeat must be 
I look out into the unknown, sure I will be swallowed, be lost, be broken
The future stretches out beneath me
I know now
The fear seems so foolish
All the time, all the opportunities I wasted, on fear 
If only I knew then, if only

I open up my eyes to bright and fleeting faces
Just because I knew this was always coming doesn't mean I was ready
Tomorrow, they'll all be gone
I'll be gone
And all I have left to hold onto is &ldquo;one day&rdquo;
Even though I try to hold on, it's all slipping through my fingers, one slow second at a time
I want to say goodbye, but I can't find the right words, can't speak
So I just keep looking
Give me one more minute, and always one more

I open up my eyes to the floor shifting underneath me
Tiles, cold and perversely clean
I feel the world stop, just for that instant, just for me 
I feel my life change, like some giant hand snipped only that one string

You dragged me onto the dance floor, to catch the last slow dance
I asked you what you wanted, you said you just wanted to talk to me
We stood there awkwardly for a moment, and you reminded me it was a dance
I threw my arms around your neck, to give you a chance, to hear you out
Your hands found my waist and as you spoke, my eyes welled with tears and you asked me not to cry
You told me you were sorry, and for the first time, I really believe you
Dancing with you felt so right, and although it was hard, I'm glad that's how we ended the night
I rested my head on your chest, probably for the last time
This moment was so bittersweet, and in the end, I'm glad we both came
Then the lights came on along with the end of the song
You made me smile and laugh, and said you were happy you still could
As we walked back toward the door, I wanted to grab your hand
We both stopped and looked at one another
I felt so much joy when you told me I looked amazing
I felt ecstatic when you admitted you couldn't help but look at me
You looked pretty damn good too, and we both stood there with smiles
This goodbye was so much harder than all the rest
Especially when you walked to catch her
I'll admit that this night ended with tears
But I'm so happy we got the last dance.

Wind
Buffets me at every turn,
But I do not hear it.
Footsteps,
While nearby,
Feel like they are a mile away.
Voices,
Although clear,
Are muffled,
As if, they were behind a padded wall. 
Am I alone?
No,
I am not.
But here, it is quiet,
And here is where I can let my sinner self, run free
To worlds one can only dream,
To where I can break the shackles of reality,
Even for just a moment,
And become who I've always wanted to be.

Skin of porcelain, 
Lips a cherry red, but slowly turning a shade
Of purple plum due to the icy breeze.
Eyes are a stormy grey as her mind is 
Crowded with thoughts.
She is highly breakable and has a fragile
But kind heart.

An antique sold at very low cost,
She's worth a fortune but not seen as beautiful.
No one likes amateur Barbie anymore.
Everyone grew out of that stage a long time ago.

A collector's item taken out of the box
And treated far too hard.
She tries to tell them she's no mere toy,
But once playtime was over she was just thrown
Back in the meaningless toy box.

Now she is cracked. 
Not even the best of Elmer's Glue can stitch her up,
Because she's made of shining glass,
Not worthlessness.

And yet they left her in the cold
With no one,
Because they think of her as a weak stuffed doll who needs a master.
She's more than that.
She can prove it.
But she doesn't want to break. 
Not again.

Skin of porcelain,
Lips a cherry red,
Eyes stormy grey.
She still smiles,
But it's sort of cracked.

I was in an empty room,
but it was full of loud silence
it was so quiet that I was about to be deaf
and because of that,
I start stressing out myself;
Thinking things that I shouldn't be thinking
making scenarios in my head that
freaking me out,
and trying to find a solution to a simple problem;
making everything complicated.
All I ever do is to overthink,
and it's killing me.

So I decided to plugged my earphones in my ears and played my songs before I drown to my overflowing thoughts.

Surprisingly, everything became clear and calm.
without any bone moving,
I wasn't in the quiet room
anymore, but I am now in a place where "stress doesn't exist."
I am in a place where it describes the feeling of "relief"

music...
music is my rope to hold on
whenever I put my self in the situation where I'm about to fall into depression.

Cluttered thoughts scribbled
Into a notebook,
Crumbled papers
Fill the floors.
Stacks of broken pencils
Mountains of dry pens
Writing on napkins
Doodling on palms
Nights spent placing her thoughts on paper
Days spent sleeping 
To make up for the lack of rest
She spends hours tearing up failures.
She wants to find her voice.
They say mind over matter.
She says she has no choice.

I once knew a girl,
she was like a bird
flying gracefully
in the sky above
happy and free
and  everything was all-right,
but as time passed by
and things had changed,
The girl I once knew,
is now drifting away
As if the wings she used to fly
broke and fell from sky
the smile in her lips turned into frowns
all her happiness were gone
and turned into sorrows
just because in one wrong turned,
she found herself, lost and scared.
and I wonder if the girl I used to know,
someday, somehow,
will find her way,
To get back her self
learn to spread her wings
and to learn to fly, again.

I am not a beauty queen,
I am not perfect,
I am full of flaws as you can see.
I am simple and plain,
and full of insecurities.
I am not talented and smart
like the rest,
I am not one of the goddess 
nor belong to the best of the bests.

I am not a beauty queen
like those in pageants.
and I am not the type of girl everyone wants.
but afterall, maybe I am a beauty queen.

I am not perfect and no one is.
I am not every one wants and
no one is like by everyone.

I am not a beauty queen 
in everyone eyes, 
but I am in God sight.
Maybe I can just accept who I am
and embrace it.
I am God's limited creation,
and I should be proud of it.
I know for God, and I know in myself,
I am a beauty queen, not just in looks
but in my heart.

I knew a little girl, a long time ago
She was bright and full of life
She would say her prayers at night
And live her faith daily.
But this little girl I once knew
Got older, like a child that inhabits
So beautiful, she shined. I loved this girl because
She was my rock.
But people change, she lost her faith.
&ldquo;There is no God&rdquo; replaced the prayers
&ldquo;A figment of the imagination of the people
That couldn't except when we go no where
When we die&rdquo; she'd explain.
Hers perspective squed and shifted
&ldquo;there is too much tragedy

&ldquo;The devil is an excuse

While God is an excuse for

Find a mirror and stare deep&rdquo; and she grew up.

What happened when to frank when he died?
Nothing special I assume
Frank was nothing special,
The definition or what it means to be average.
So lowered into the ground Frank went.
With little to no thought of how completely unaverage this man is.
Frank is star dust,
As everyone living on Earth,
He stole his life from hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.
So what really happened when Frank died?
Well, he became a star once again.

I'll run to the ocean,
Live a life by the water
Because the mountains no longer suffice,
Lost in this valley, adventure is what I need,
I want to find me, decide who it is that
I am destined to be
I can't quite
Stand smog and snow, this bowl
Has trapped who lives inside me, and
She wishes to escape, to go and flee
So I'll run to the ocean,
Live a life by the water
And what the sea can to for me.

Pushing open glass doors
My bare feet on the cold, warm floor.
Sending shivers through the length of my legs,
Letting me know I'm home.
The feel of painting on wood runs through out
My sweating fingertips, as I race across
The length of this commonly know pole.
There's a face.
It is the face in every mirror I look at.
But when the feel of that ballet pole is caressed,
Gently in my hold,
That face,
Is a different face.
Compared to all the times I've seen it.
In my home, in the halls,
Or anywhere else that I have come across my reflection.
None compare to who I see
When I look upon that giant mirror
Surrounded by music
Unjustified in space and creativity.
I see who I am 
Who I am striving to become.
Not only am I lost in myself
But
I believe in myself
Laying on that cold, dirty, wooden floor
Heart pumping.
Adrenaline racing!
That is where I want to be.
And its up to me/
To get there myself...

Sometimes I get this out-of-body-feeling
Wondering what's the meaning, the purpose,
Who is this girl I'm in?
What am I doing? Or why?
Why am I living?
What's the gleaming, shiny prize,
At the end of this unforgivable, long road?
It's like this existential crisis,
What's the point? 
Will I ever be what I want to be?
Probably not. 
I mean, look at this dream-crushing job market.
I feel like I'm just a robot,
Succumbing to society's thoughts and principals.
Doing what I'm supposed to do.
Go to school,
Get a job,
Get married,
Have a few kids, 
And then die.
But why?
"Just be a good little girl,"
They say to me,
Every little thing I do is criticized,
A red mark to the paper,
A failing grade,
A disappointment to bring home,
To people I love so very much.
It's like this letter makes me,
Determines who I will be,
Steers my life,
And I'm just another machine produced in this world.
So what's the point?
Why do I work, and work,
For a future I'm not even sure 
WHY I want?
Oh, they say to me,
"Life is a race kid, don't get left behind."
I disagree.
Because you see,
But you see,
When I get this out-of-body feeling
It's like I'm not me,
And life is a simulation
I'm just controlling a body, a person
And so I say, "life is a game."
If the robot they have created 
Is accepted in society,
Then you have won the game.
My, the game even gives rewards!
Money, fame, your heart's desire.
So who owns this game of life?
Who decides which robot wins or loses?
Some say god, 
Some say the government, or world leaders.
So why don't I have the right to control it?
The NSA's just watching our every move,
So don't I get any freedom?
I mean,
If life has no real purpose,
Then shouldn't I get to determine my destiny?
Why should I become another product of society?
Another result,
Another test score,
Just one more statistic?
Let me do it my way,
Whether that means me being,
Successful, or an unemployed bum,
Let me do it my way.
They will not control me.
I will be free.

when the sun leans down to kiss the earth,
it fills the sky with secrets
thousands on thousands of murmuring lights
how they beckon as you lie sleepless
 
there -- cassiopeia, bound to a chair, lost in her own reflection
beside her sleeps andromeda fair, under perseid protection
a tangle of tragedies plays out on this stage
as the mercurial moon watches over
but the stars know more than their scenes let on
enigmas held tight like lovers
 
you may see pegasus spread his majestic wings
you may watch his easy flight
but you will never know the astral wind
that carries him, whisper-sweet
aquarius' bright cup runneth over
with a gushing galaxy
but he alone can know the taste
of that purest cosmic spring
though cygnus stretches his neck to hear
lyra's nimble euphonies,
these arias will never reach your ear
they are but ill-fated, lilting coquetries
 
how many riddles pierce this ink-dark night?
how many make this celestial susurrus?
all these searing splendors yet concealed
does it pain you to know we are blind t o so much?
or do you watch the stars glimmer in the glassy lake
cast pebbles across them and think,
'this is enough.'

oh how i grasp at the crumbling evidence of your presence 
snatch curls of torn paper and stuff them under my tongue
to savor and forget that once we sucked on starlight instead

your inky footprints cross my ceiling and my heart, 
spattering the pages of my books
staining the periphery and dripping from my hair

this monochrome is sweet, but the best is in our heads
that shared taiga teeming with 'until'
luminous dragonflies that spark and crackle when we catch them
there is color here and the scent of familiar contentment

we return there often, with feet bare and voices cascading
the technicolor past and the greyscale present are 
the doors through which we run.

Wild flowers with wild thorns

What the hell did you expect?
You thought you were the protagonist?
You thought you were the main character,
That things would turn out right just for you?
You are nothing.
You are an extra in your own story.
You aren't given the curtsey of being ignored,
You aren't even noticed.
The world doesn't care for you,
Your profound thoughts
And your deep troubles.
They aren't unique. They aren't important.
Your emotions don't run deeper.
Give up your shred of inner pride.
Give up sanity;
And accept your demise.

I don't always dream, but when I do,
Friends become obstinate,
Rage is unleashed,
And the world melts away as I float above it all
In a veil of tears.

(Also there was that one time my yard was filled with blue and orange crocodiles. That was weird.)

Nightmares are only great in retrospect,
And in dreams I find myself
Forgetting things.
Things I thought I knew, but that
Slip tantalizingly away
When viewed in black and white.

Why are you following me, wolf?
Please stop, I just want to go home.
Are you even a wolf?
But wait, it's collapsing.
Because that street was definitely in &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;,
Stolen from my thoughts.

It's just like real life.
When my mom's head spoke to me
From that fish tank,
I knew the words were profound.
But I'll never remember.

How do I feel?
Well, I could say it was brilliant,
Which would be true,
But that's not answering the question,
Is it?
So I'll say the truth,
Because I have nothing to lose, telling you.
It scared me.
It rocked me to my core.
I remember when I laughed,
But much more vividly, I recall
Snowden, freezing to death 
In a pool of warm light.
Paradoxes are always felt more,
Because isn't your cold skin
Much warmer, when touching mine?
I'm cold, so cold.
There, there. There, there.

Wind whistles through the trees
plucking leaves off the branches
as they float like feathers to the ground.
I lie gazing at the beams of sunlight
seeping through the intertwined arms
of the tree towering above me and
tickling everything it touches
with its warm fingers. 
I am still. I am thinking.
As nature consumes all my senses.
All at once the wind stops,
and everything is silent.
A butterfly crosses my sight,
dancing and fluttering around jauntily.
All my thoughts and cares cease.
I focus on the whimsical movements
of this delicate being, and
I can only think of how
I wish I could feel that kind of

Icy cotton balls
Danced through the
Bitter air.
Keeping playgrounds
Empty and
Couches crammed with
Shivering hot cocoa holders. 
Blankets were cloaked over
Rows of cuddlers with
Multi-colored fuzzy socks
Sticking out the bottom.
Anxiety was rising as
Hopes of clear weather
Crossed minds fill with
Pictures of snowmen and igloos.
Finally,
They emerged out of their
Protective cave and out into
The winter wonderland.
The blinding snow lay
Blanketed across the earth
Untouched.
Awaiting the wandering 
Imagination of
Energetic children preparing for
Hours and hours of restless work.
And when all efforts were,
Exhausted,
The little boots retrieved
Back into the house
Where a tub of warm water
Overflowing with bubbles
Was waiting to thaw
The near-frozen toes
Of a day well spent.

At the end of each day
You release a great sigh
From the pain of misfortune,
But the bones never lie.

You wonder, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
You ask yourself, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What did I do wrong?&rdquo;
But the bones never lie.

You feel all alone,
And your hope has run dry,
As anger and sorrow take over,
But the bones never lie.

But this is not your fault!
And the time draws nigh
When you must let go, move along,
And let the broken bones lie.

                <p>
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more painful, and more abhorrent.
Alarm clocks scream to everyone's dismay,
And school and work unleash a dread torrent.
Sometime too perfect is a weekend morn',
And warm doth its appearance seem to be,
‘Till tainted by the faces so forlorn,
The faces of those who hath thought of thee.
But thy eternal hellfire shall not die,
Nor lose the hate thou always receiveth,
Nor shall men ever wake when work is nigh,
Nor shall minds of men thy looks deceiveth.
So long as human obligations stay,
So say we this, &ldquo;We all hate you, Monday.&rdquo;

The sun shone in the sky
With a lustrous white light
As I mosied through the forest,
Feeling everything was right.

Suddenly, I heard a crunch,
The crunch of a foot on dry leaves,
And the sky grew dark and gray with clouds,
And the birds flew from the trees.

I heard a soft, but chilling, clink,
Like spurs one would use on a horse,
And the sound drew closer with each booming step,
And I froze with not but a sound I could force.

The sounds drew near and came to a halt.
I turned very slowly around. 
And there are not proper words to describe
The nightmarish thing that I found.

Standing before me was a man,
Dare I label it such.
For it had not a head
And was cold to the touch.

It was dressed in an old uniform.
It was covered in mud.
And in its hand was a large axe,
Stained dark red with blood.

It raised its great axe
And took aim at my head, 
But I could not move my legs
And I knew I was dead.

But, wait! What was this?
I heard someone coming!
The monster lowered his axe,
And was suddenly running.

Then I heard a strange sound,
Like the rising of the dead, 
And a horse shot from the ground,
Body white as snow, eyes glowing red.

And it stopped before the beast,
And the thing mounted its steed,
And it gave a hard kick with its heel,
And the pair shot off with great speed.

Then another man came into view
And he asked what was wrong,
And I pointed to where the creature ran,
But it was already gone.

It's been many years since that day
When I heard the leaves crunch on the ground,
And the jingle of those spurs,
And saw that...wait...What's that sound…?

The markets are run
By pure money and greed,
And inflation is high,
So more money's not what we need!

The mints need to stop.
If we keep on this path,
Debt will shoot through the roof
And we'll feel our creditors' wrath.

And by borrowing funds
To help pay off our debts
We're now more in the hole,
And how deep can it get?!

But if this all stops,
And we let the banks fall,
We might be able to recover,
And put a stop to it all.

This needs to end here,
This debt creation must stop.
Let London Bridge fall down,
And let's build it back up.

Oh Audi, sweet Audi,
My lovely little car,
You have your fair share of dents
And your engine is somewhat subpar.

You need four new tires,
And an engine belt too,
And the trim that hangs off you
Can't be fixed with just glue.

Your steering is not straight,
And your gears sometimes slide,
And your axles need realigning;
Your wheels spin slightly on their sides.

Your carpets are stained,
Some of your dash lights have quit,
And the driver's side floor mat
Has a fish hook stuck in it.
(No one knows.)

Yet your engine runs well,
And your handling's great,
Which is quite fun to exploit,
In the winding canyons of this state.

And your trunk space is crazy,
Big enough to fit me,
And part of the seat can pull down
So you can fit skis.

I love you so far,
And though it's close call,
I think maybe the Germans
Had it right after all.

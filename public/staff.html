I joined West Winds three years ago, I don't remember what compelled me to, any reason or rhyme to my decision, It just sort of happened. That year I jumped in head first and never regretted a second of the experience. My first year I applied to become the layout editor of the 2012 edition, &ldquo;Journeys,&rdquo; I got the position, and to the best of my knowledge, that year as a young and brash sophomore, I became the youngest Layout Editor West Winds has ever seen. West Winds became an integral part of my high school experience, week to week I would go to meetings and slowly but surely, gather concepts and ideas, a conglomerate, that came into being as this year's edition, &ldquo;Legacies.&rdquo; West Winds spurred in me a deep love for art, literature and the English language, ultimately driving me to my decision to attend Westminster College and pursue a degree in English.
West Winds, however, is not my only passion, I am a dancer, a member of the West High School Dance Company. I am a journalist, and a staff member on the Red and Black. I am a singer and a song writer, having taught myself to play the guitar and the ukulele. I am an avid reader, writer and learner, always eager to absorb some new information and synthesize it, placing it into a larger context. I am a history buff and a massive music fanatic.

Hello strangers! This is my bio I guess, so, enjoy yourself! I joined West Winds in hopes to help expand the literary elements in West. I never really knew what to except from this but this has become a new interest to me. I enjoyed spending time with those on the staff and spending time after school with them. There was NEVER a dull moment! I love photography, some of my photos are in here! I hope you like them!

I am a website editor&#8212;I made the backbone of this year's online edition, working with Emma and submissions editors. This has been my first year with West Winds, and I joined because I have always admired the work of previous years' staff and submitters. I'll be glad if I have boosted the presentation and accessibility of this year's wonderful collection of art.

Chancelor William DeLaMare, the relentlessly sardonic helper monkey of doom. I joined from curiosity regarding what West Winds is, and I found my answer.
West winds has been a family of sorts, it bonds us together and makes us think while we laugh. I have been glad to provide my support, from helping with the poetry slams to helping the other members out on a bad day, usually with a level I of sarcastic empathy.
It has been a joy working on this hundredth West Winds, I hope you find as much joy reading it!

I joined West Winds because I love poetry and the visual arts, and I wanted to meet people with similar interests so I could blather about modernist poetry and abstract expressionism without people calling me a snob to my face.  I also wanted to get the chance both to be awed by other teenager's work and to occasionally show off my own.  I'm an aspiring artist and poet who dreams of one day living in a minuscule New York City apartment with 10 artist friends.  I draw inspiration from the people around me and hipster photos on the internet.

My name is Izzy Srivastava. I am a freshman, and I joined West Winds approximately six weeks ago. I think the magazine is a wonderful publication that showcases some of the tremendous artistic talent at this school, and I am both very thrilled and very honored to be a part of it, if a somewhat recent addition.

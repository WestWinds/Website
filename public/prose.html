                <div class="title">How Dakota Marie Came to Be</div>
                <div class="author">Alyson Kyle</div>
                <p>
    &ldquo;Sweetheart, come here.&rdquo; I heard my mom call from nearby. I placed my book down flat on the table, bending its spine. I know, not good for the book, I just don't have a bookmark. I found both of my parents sitting in the kitchen. 
    &ldquo;What's going on?&rdquo; I asked quietly.
    &ldquo;Well, now that you're eight, we've both decided you're old enough to pick your name,&rdquo; my dad grinned.
    &ldquo;You mean I no longer have to be Marie?&rdquo; I asked.
    &ldquo;Not unless you want to be,&rdquo; my mom said eagerly.
    You see, my mom and dad are both very stubborn. So for the past eight years, they've called me sweetie, or darling, or something similar. At school I've always written Marie, my last name, on all my papers. I don't like going by my last name, and since they could never agree on naming me, I get to. My choice, not theirs.
    &ldquo;Can I think about it?&rdquo; I said, feeling my lips curl into a smile.
    &ldquo;Of course, after all, this will always be your name,&rdquo; my mother said, almost too cheerfully.
    Always? As in forever? Forever. It'll be written on my tombstone. There are so many wonderful names. What if I chose wrong? There's got to be a million names out there and I can only pick one. One. I gulped. My dad gave me a reassuring smile and dismissed me. So I did what any other person in my situation would do. I went back to my book.
    I could be Nancy, like Nancy Drew. Named after a fictional detective. Cool. Nancy Marie. No, not right. Most girls I know are named Jennifer or April. I could do that, but it doesn't fit me either. It was copying, too.
    My eyes wandered the room, eventually they landed on my dad's globe, which was sitting on his desk. Slowly, but surely, my feet were drawn toward it. So many places. North Carolina, I read in bold black letters. I live there, it's so tiny compared to the rest of the world. I spun the globe and as it slowed, I placed my left pointer finger down. It landed on Turkey. Not a good name, I'd get bullied without a doubt. Mongolia? Iran? Spain? Liberia? No, no, no, and definitely no. I spun the globe again, and it landed on Charlotte. No, that's where I live. As pretty as Charlotte, North Carolina, is, I want out. I want to travel, a lot. See the beauty, the ugly, and everything else I can't see here. Chad. Hmm. I like it.
    &ldquo;I think I know my name.&rdquo; I called out excitedly. My dad sat next to me. &ldquo;Chad?&rdquo; I asked expectantly.
    &ldquo;That's a boy's name,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Any others?&rdquo;
    I shook my head, indicating no. I kept staring at the globe.
    &ldquo;Well, you don't have to decide today. It's almost bedtime anyway.&rdquo; He continued talking, but I zoned out. Eventually he kissed my head and left.
    The globe once again got my full attention. Nevada? No. Ontario? Nope. Egypt? No. Not in this lifetime. Besides, it's too small
    This is useless. I'll never find the right name. I was about to give up when I read Dakota. Dakota Marie. I like it. A lot actually. It fits me, in a way. I could see getting letters addressed from insurance companies to Dakota Marie. Birthday cards, bills, checks, plane tickets, report cards, notes, all for Dakota Amberlyn Marie. And yes, they did agree on a middle name. My mom's name is Amber, my dad's name is Lynn, so they combined them. I'm Dakota Marie.
    I could've done a number of things in that moment. For one, I could tell my parents, but I didn't. Instead, I went outside and stretched out on our hammock and read my novel with my reading light. When I got bored, I shut off the light and just let my eyes adjust to the night sky. Eventually I could see all the stars illuminating the way.
    The stars are a weird thing, in my opinion. They hold so much beauty when they're just huge fiery balls. I find it weird. Some of them may be dead and the light is still tumbling through space, reaching our eyes. They're dead, but they look alive. My mom says people can be like that. My best friend was like that. She was paralyzed and before she passed last year, she was trapped in her body for twelve weeks, dead, but breathing. Maybe that's why I'm Dakota. Not because of a stupid globe, but because of Cheyenne. Her parents chose her name by looking at a globe at three in the morning. Maybe I wanted to feel a connection to her.
    The fear of my parents rejecting my name slowly vanished. It wasn't for them, it was for me. I wanted to be Dakota. Not Marie, or Harmony, or Cinnamon like they'd fought about when my mom was pregnant. I'm Dakota.
    I went to my room and sat on my bed. A short time later my parents came inside.
    &ldquo;What about Dakota?&rdquo; I asked, feeling a smile curl into my face, right on my lips.
    &ldquo;Dakota Marie?&rdquo; my mom said, and I nodded to reply. When she didn't reply, I felt my face drop.
    &ldquo;Dakota Marie is a lovely name,&rdquo; my mom giggled as once again a smile formed. I was obviously relieved. 
    &ldquo;I agree. A beautiful name for a beautiful girl,&rdquo; my dad said.
    As my dad's left foot crossed the threshold, he turned to face me, his eyes shining in pride. His face looked permanently plastered with a goofy smile.
    &ldquo;Dakota?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Yes?
    &ldquo;Happy birthday.&rdquo;
    He shut the door and as my head hit my pillow I mentally prepared myself for another sleepless night. Ever since Chey died it happened nearly every single night. I was along with my thoughts, trying to remember her hair, her voice, anything to keep me close. But something was different, as I closed my eyes, I could barely stay awake. I was falling asleep.
    &ldquo;Goodnight Cheyenne,&rdquo; I whispered into my empty room.
    As sleep took over my body for the first time in months, I could've sworn I heard the faint whisper of &ldquo;Goodnight Dakota.&rdquo; And in a moment, I felt at peace with myself. I, Dakota Marie, fell asleep without a tear drop in sight.

                <p>
     My parents never had to tell me not to drink, they never had to say anything along the lines of, &ldquo;It may seem like it could solve some of your problems briefly, but it will do more harm than good.&rdquo; Instead I was shown the why not. Repeatedly. You can't romanticize killing yourself; it's not beautiful or poetic. Drowning yourself in that liquid everyday was anything but heroic. It's sad. It's depressing. Beautiful should never be used to describe an alcoholic's addiction. It was not the sound of a child's laugh or the sunset. It was literally a disease shutting down his liver, shortly after his kidneys. The alcohol was poison and he drank countless cans of it everyday since the age of 11, the age he ran away from home, he ran away from his abusive family who adopted him a few years before. Empty cans littered the living room floor, his breath smelled putrid. I promise it was not beautiful. With every can, I saw his heart hollow out a little more, everything good about the man behind those cans, would fade. Pointless anger over the childhood he never had and the family he never knew filled his eyes. Every sip symbolized to him so unresolved pain burning inside of him, every time the bottle went up and the liquid foun its way down his throat, the man I loved would disappear. Nothing about it was beautiful.
     At six years old, you don't understand your father is slowly killing himself. The world is still a beautiful safe place where everyone is loved, and magic exists and good wins every time. Alcohol was never good, yet it seemed to win anyway. Whenever my mom went away on business trips, he'd pick up those cans and drink like it was a way of survival, the only way to keep his heart pumping, the only way to keep oxygen flowing into his lungs. It was not beautiful. On the days he'd drink, it would start off good, sometimes even great. He'd talk to me as we walked to the store, ask about my friends and it was nice, he even let me pick out some cans and soda so when he bought those cans, I didn't feel left out. In those moments, I was a six year old on top of the world.
     The drinking would start, slow at first. Always slow, like a gentle warm up before a marathon. He'd become loopy and relax, even laugh a little. As the night progressed, his eyes would glaze over and it seemed like he was completely numb. Eventually that numbness would turn into anger and he'd scream insults at anything and everything. Even the anger didn't last long before he turned into a crying mess, strikingly similar to a five year old who stubbed his toe, all eventually would be forgotten. So I'd lock the doors and make sure my older sister was asleep and then I'd climb into bed and read until his crying stopped and he had either gone to bed or passed out. It wasn't heroic. At nine years old, I still had the same habits of locking him in and making sure my sister was fine.
     When he wasn't drinking, he was genuinely the nicest person I knew, but I began to automatically associate the alcohol as a part of him. An extra limb he was dependent on. I hated the alcohol, so I grew to hate the man. I did not know at six, seven, eight or nine what I know now. He had an addiction and it would not go away overnight no matter how much he loved me. It took getting liver disease for him to realized he was just killing himself, a slow painful death as his liver turned to stone. My dad and I will probably never be close, not in a way I want to be at least. We can bond over similar music tastes or a movie we saw together, but that's about it. But having him here is enough, I wish we were closer, but it's better than being nine years old sitting in a hospital as my parents explained to my sister and me in the best way possible that our father was dying. There was no best way of course and everyone knew that. Anything was better than watching him pick his addiction over and over again instead of his friends, his job, my mom, my sister and most of all me. But the thing about alcohol is, those who drink can eventually down enough beer to forget, at least most of it, but someone like me can't. Those memories stay with me and they probably always will be. That is no heroic or beautiful. Anything was prettier than his addiction.

   I was delivering Christmas presents at my father's office, and hanging on the wall in one of the cubicals was a poster that caught my eye. It read &ldquo;I hate it when I offer somebody a sincere compliment on their moustache, and suddenly she is not my friend anymore&rdquo;. 
   That got me thinking about hair and facial hair and moustaches in particular. I am a big fan of luscious locks on top of people's heads, but I am trying to decide how I feel about hair in other places.
   I think handle bar moustaches look pretty cool on some people, but on others, any sort of moustache seems to turn into a molestache.
   Side burns look good, but I don't like the feel of them on my face.
   There's so many ways to grow a beard&#8212;good and bad. A well groomed beard can sometimes look a little intimidating and &ldquo;manly&rdquo;, but once you get to &ldquo;Duck Dynasty&rdquo; status, you start to look gross, and almost like a small animal or bird will emerge out of the dense jungle growing off the bottom of your face.
   As I was pondering beards, a question arose... why do the top of people's heads go bald but not the bottom? Why does facial hair almost always continue to grow through the elder years of life, but head hair starts to fall out? The result of this is old people whose heads are all upside down-hair on the bottom instead of on the top.
   I am very fond of the song by Crosby Stills, Nash, and Young titled &ldquo;Almost Cut My Hair&rdquo;. Every time I get a haircut, I believe I am killing a part of myself.
   Hair is a defining feature of most people, and often portrays personality. Individuals with boring hair are usually boring. Individuals with fun hair are fun.
   I've eight months until I have to look like a dreary clone at BYU, so until then, I will cherish every moment I get to spend with my hair.
   To all of you, I appreciate your hair. It is all so different and colorful and makes my day more interesting.

                <div class="title">What is in a name?</div>

                <p>
What is in a name?
Why do we call a ball a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; or a dog a &ldquo;dog&rdquo;? What does it mean to call a human by their name, by their title? Why don't we just give them a number and call it good? Wouldn't that be pretty easy? No more mixing up people with the same names! But then the art is dead. The joy a parent is blessed with when the opportunity to name a child is gone. Language is an art&#8212;a spoken art. Art is not to be judged by finding flaws. This art is to be judged by finding beauty within imperfection, within the things that don't seem right. So what is in a name? Absolutely nothing, but positively everything.

   Breathe slowly and inhale the luminescent particles. Let the energy of the light raise you up. Inhale the glory and exhale your weakness like the sun scattering dark clouds of woe. Relive memories of fantastic success then let them go, sliding off your body like soap on tile, refreshing and good. Breathe and as you do ponder...
   What is love? 
   Skin deep passion that burns and leaves brief blisters before healing almost perfectly. 
   A light dusting of puppy love blush across innocent cheeks, that washes off in the first rain but warmth still glows at the memory. 
   A data cable affair transferring head to head, bypassing the body, but scratching the heart enough to scab over. 
   Eye-opening fling that exposes the soul and either leaves it raw and bleeding or brings it to new growth. 
   True love echoes from the core of the heart through all of time collecting heart, mind, body, and soul in a flight that grows taller than any tree and deeper than any root. True love learns eye to eye and connects heart to heart. It flows from pool to pool gathering sticks and stones, but always managing to slide past and continue on. 
   As you realize all this is love and more, let the particles form lines to connect you to everything around. Exhale and let it all go. Now you are free.

                <div class="title">Chapter 1, Margaret and Robert</div>
                <div class="author">Carolyn Janecek</div>
                <p>
    Robert sat on a stool by Margaret's bedside. He held his wife's hand, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles, trying not to feel the way they jut out, or to hear her labored breathing. He smiled at her weakly; but the dark circles etched under his eyes were proof that the past nine months had taken their toll on him. Like his wife, he had grown gaunt and lost the color from his face, but not from sickness. 
    But each day he rose early to change Margaret's bloody pillow case and stained handkerchief. He always wiped away the residue of her night sweats off her skin and washed her hair in a nearby basin. He brought meals to her bed, but was forced to watch her wither away even as she ate. 
    Every passing day he found it harder to smile. Harder to even look at his children, especially his little girl who was the spitting image of his dying wife. He tried to keep them happy, even as his young twins were on the verge of losing their mother. 
    Claude had begun drifting away from him during Margaret's sickness. Robert never believed that such a tender-aged child could feel the resentment his son had begun to harbor. Claude blamed Robert for her deterioration, blamed his father for keeping his mother behind closed doors during her final months. He didn't know that it was Margaret who insisted, even on her deathbed, that the twins could not see her, to protect them from the consumption. 
    His daughter reacted differently. Erika distanced herself from the stench of death and instead, grew more and more attached to Robert, to the point when on some days she refused to let him out of her sight. She stayed away from her mother, content to believe that by doing so, her sickness would stay out of sight and out of mind.
    &ldquo;And when you get better, we can all go out and have a picnic, just the way we used to.&rdquo; Robert's voice was tender as he forced another smile. He pushed back a curl of her copper blond hair.
    Margaret looked as if she were about to say something, but was seized by a cough that wracked through her body, rattling like dried leaves caught in a gust of wind. Robert reached out to her, but there was nothing he could do but wait for it to subside. When she finally turned to him, she looked dazed and blood covered her hands and the bed sheets.
    Robert stared blankly at the blood on the stark white sheets. He tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat. Instead, he began to gather up the bedding.
    His wife put her hand on his forearm. &ldquo;Don't. They'll get dirty again.&rdquo;
    He sat down helplessly, but began talking again. He was urgent, even as his voice cracked, &ldquo;A-and you can teach Erika to embroider. We can read them stories again before they&#8212;&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo; Margaret's voice was firm as she put her hand over his. Her features were tender, yet dignified, &ldquo;Robert, I'm dying.&rdquo;
    Robert felt as if barbed wire was tightening around his innards, his chest became a vacuum and he felt his lungs shrivel. 
    &ldquo;No. Of course you're not dying.&rdquo; His voice trembled at the sight of his wife's tranquility; she had already accepted death as an old friend. He clung onto his wife's hand. &ldquo;You can't just give up. Margaret, you can't die!&rdquo; A sob escaped him and he turned his head away, she couldn't see him like this.
    Margaret smiled sadly, running her hand along Robert's jawline, the once proper and clean-shaven man had a bristled chin and gray streaks in his mussed hair. She cupped his face in her hands and he turned his eyes to her, bloodshot and glistening.
    &ldquo;You did everything you could, don't blame yourself.&rdquo; She squeezed his hand, &ldquo;I'm in God's hands now.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Margaret, this isn't a goodbye. Think of Claude and Erika.&rdquo; His voice broke as he wept, &ldquo;What about me? What will I do without you?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;I'll still be with you.&rdquo; She smiled, but her eyes were glazing over, &ldquo;I'll always love you, Robert.&rdquo; She closed her eyes, exhausted. 
    Robert stayed frozen by Margaret's bedside as she slept. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; He murmured. Then, he got up and tucked the covers around her, and somehow he knew that his wife wouldn't wake up again.

                <p>
&ldquo;Moooooom!&rdquo; James screamed as he ran into the kitchen where his mother Violet was.
&ldquo;What's wrong baby?&rdquo; Violet responded as she rushed to her crying sons' side.
&ldquo;I was chasing after Mr. Whiskers and a rock tripped me!&rdquo; With tears streaming down his face he pointed down at his left knee that had been scraped by cement.
&ldquo;Here let me kiss it better.&rdquo; She bent down and kissed the knee that he was pointing at. &ldquo;Is there anything else that hurts?&rdquo; James thought about this for a moment and then pointed at his right elbow. Violet kissed that too. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; James shook his head wiping the tears away from his red eyes. &ldquo;I know what will make you feel better.&rdquo; A big grin came across Violets face. &ldquo;Playing with your dolls.&rdquo; She laughed.
&ldquo;They are not dolls mom, they are action figures!&rdquo; James Grumbled.
&ldquo;Well they are about to be mine, RACE YOU THERE!&rdquo; She yelled as she ran over to the stairs. James giggled as he raced up the stairs after her.

Violet squinted her eyes trying to identify the thing that had made a noise. &ldquo;Oh my goodness, your father just pulled into the driveway, you should get to bed before he gets in the house or you'll be in big trouble mister.&rdquo; Violet pushed James over to the stairs.
&ldquo;Awww ok.&rdquo; James said as he disappeared upstairs to his room. Violet took a deep breath and put on her lovely smile.
&ldquo;Hello honey.&rdquo; Martin said with his big smile as he opened the door. &ldquo;I hope I didn't get here too late for supper.&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Of course not, we always eat supper at 10&rdquo; she kissed his cheek and giggled. &ldquo;It's wrapped in tin foil on the second shelf of the fridge&rdquo;
&ldquo;You're the best.&rdquo; Martin said as he hung up his worn black suit coat in the closet. &ldquo;So how was your day?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh you know, just taking care of the house and James&rdquo; She giggled again.
Martin raised his eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he said in a questioning manner, inquiring her for more details.
&ldquo;Yea he is so clumsy, he tripped and scrapped his knee. He is okay now though, we went up to his room and played transformers or cars or whatever it is.&rdquo; She looked up at Martin. &ldquo;How was your day? Are you any closer to finishing that big deal?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Unfortunately no, you know how it is, all of the corporate rules and what not.&rdquo; Martin realized that he had been staring off into space and looked over at Violet.
&ldquo;Well, I'm heading to bed now, I should get enough sleep to go to the park with James tomorrow&rdquo; She kissed Martin. &ldquo;Goodnight babe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Goodnight&rdquo; Martin responded staring off into space again. &ldquo;I have a phone call I need to make then I'll be heading to bed myself.&rdquo; He watched Violet as she walked up the stairs. He sighed and took a bite of his wife's chicken casserole. &ldquo;She was doing so well too.&rdquo; He pulled out his cell phone and put it up against his ear. &ldquo;Yes hello, Doctor? You told me to call you if she started again. Uh huh. Yea. Ok how about I call you back, let's say tomorrow at seven-o-clock? Alright, thank you.&rdquo; A rush of grief came over him as he put his phone back into his pocket. He took another bite of the casserole.

&ldquo;Well what did Ms. Moore say about this? Oh really? So her company said never? Well that's a bit of a setback. I guess we hope that the Smithson Company accepts our offer&rdquo; Martin looked up to see his assistant Mason waving his hand in the usual way to get his attention. &ldquo;Can you give me one second, Thanks. What do you need Mason?&rdquo;
&ldquo;There is a Doctor on line 3 asking to talk to you.&rdquo; Mason said in his soft mouse like voice.
Martin looked at the time, it was already nine minutes past seven-o-clock. &ldquo;Thanks Mason&rdquo; Martin replied as he shooed him out of the office with his free hand. &ldquo;Hey Phil? Sorry about that but something has come up, I'm going to have to call you tomorrow, ok, thanks.&rdquo; His heart started pounding as his finger pressed down on the number 3 button. &ldquo;Hel-hello&rdquo; He stammered losing his breath.
&ldquo;Hello Mr. Glensfield, I was calling you back as we discussed last night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uhm thank you for calling me back, and on such short notice to, I wanted to... I wanted to know what you think we should do.&rdquo; He questioned hesitantly.
&ldquo;Well&rdquo; He began in his nasally voice. &ldquo;Assuming that her condition is back to the way it was, we have three options; option A is that we put her back on her medications and hope they help. Option B is that we send her to the institu-&ldquo;
&ldquo;No&rdquo; Martin interrupted sternly &ldquo;I will not send my wife off to that place.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Option 3 is... shock therapy.&rdquo; He paused waiting for a response but none came. &ldquo;I know it is not an easy decision so why don't you call me back later tonight and you can inform me of your decision.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I... won't be calling you tonight, it's the night that I visit him.&rdquo; Martin replied with whisper staring off into the distance again.
&ldquo;Oh that's right, it was six years ago wasn't it?&rdquo; He had forgotten today was the anniversary.
&ldquo;Seven, seven years ago...&rdquo; Martins' voice trailed off.
&ldquo;Right well, why don't you give me call when you're ready?&rdquo; He said trying to be as thoughtful as he could.
&ldquo;Will do.&rdquo; Martin hung up the phone.

Martin was alone, he was standing in the middle of the grassy area, covered with stones neatly aligned into rows and columns. Martin's phone started buzzing breaking the silence that had lasted for over fifteen minutes. &ldquo;H-h-hello?&rdquo; He answered the phone stammering with every word.
&ldquo;Hey honey I was just calling to say that dinner is in the fridge for when you get home.&rdquo; Violet chirped happily over the phone. &ldquo;James and I are heading to bed now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Goodnight, thanks for supper and I guess I will see you in the morning.&rdquo; Martin managed to say as his heart repeatedly tried to jump out of his throat.
&ldquo;Goodnight babe!&rdquo; Violet giggled as she hung up the phone.
Martin's hand was still holding his phone up against his ear. He was staring down at the stone. A tear slowly rolled down his face as he put the phone back in his pocket. He kneeled down, He took the flowers he had bought and put them on top the stone. &ldquo;You always did like flowers.&rdquo; He whispered under his breath as he stood up. He began to walk away trying his hardest not to look back at the flowers. The beautiful violets, on top of the glossy grey speckled stone with the engraved words:

Mirrors have always scared me. When I was growing up I never looked in a mirror for a long period of time, because there was this person staring back at me. He never said anything, he just stared. As I grew older the person changed but was always there. He was persistent, I'll give him that.  The older I got the more I could look in the mirror and the person looking back at me, but he was still a mystery. Who was this person? Why should I even care that this person exists? I would always question him, but he always responded with undying silence. Yesterday I saw him again but this time he looked different, he had changed, not just how he looked but his persona, his being if you will. It was at this moment that I realized that this person, the person staring back at me was not me, but how I viewed myself. Throughout the years he didn't say anything because he never believed in himself. I questioned him back then, but now, now he is someone I would like to meet, someone I would like to work with or even spend a day with. I looked him in the eyes, greeted him, thanked him for his help throughout the years. Then the unexpected happen, he tipped his hat, smiled and left. I am no longer afraid of mirrors, because I am no longer afraid of myself.

    I sat at my kitchen table looking into the living room. I could only see a doorway of vision into the world beyond. Lego men with missing arms and heads lay strewn across the ground as the first casualties of the battle. A great gust of heated wind comes from the west and it pushes back the enemy troops. The grand general (my seven year old brother) leaps through the wreckage, pushing and pulling his army along over the hills and the blue blanket sea, before disappearing behind the enemy's wall.
    I hear explosions, and crashes, screams, and destruction. The enemy is retreating when suddenly out of nowhere a cannon and a volly of airplanes soar through the air, the general underneath them, running to warn his troops, and he disappears behind his forts wall. The airplanes crashland and send the armies scattering all across the field. Iron man soars into action blasting the general's troops with his hand lasers when he is taken down by the pex dispenser brigade. I hear more destruction as parts fly and then the tanks and cars and horses push across the land. But the enemy is smart and sends them falling down the mountain of stairs and out of sight.
    Artillery wagons and chariots drawn by skeleton horses stand on the yellow armrest hill with the archers and cannons. Then the kraken, terror of the blue blanket sea, comes into the battle. After sinking the general's navy, it moved to the land. The enemy had now achieved the technology to have sea creatures survive both in water and on land. The kraken caused havok and mass destruction to the general before being swallowed up by the giant R2D2.
    And then as quickly as it began it ended. The general pausing to brush his teeth and get his pajamas on while his troops recover and the enemy plots. The battle will continue but not until dawn. When the general has eaten and is ready for battle.

When you lose someone, there's this panic that you're going to forget them&#8212;that somehow you owe it to that person, and to that experience, to remember everything. You have to remember it clearly enough that you can slip back into the moment and live it again, and again, and it may be as sweet the second time.
   But you know that it will fade; you cannot escape the inevitability of time eroding what were the strongest emotions you had ever felt. 
   And it terrifies you. You have to write it all down, take a picture, say the words; anything that will make it sharper, firmer; anything that means you can hold on a little bit longer. You try to call up every memory you have, try to relive every second of it at will. Then, when you find that you cannot, that scares you almost as much as the loss itself. 
   The memories overtake you: sometimes just a single splitting flash or sensation, sometimes a cascade. You feel inside this ache, this throbbing wound— still raw, still tender, still yearning. 
   But a smile comes to your lips anyways, slow and melancholy. It strikes a sweet and painful chord within you, all at once. 
   You will always love them. The years will pass, the colors will fade, the memories will be rare, and forgetting will dull the pain, but you will always love them. 
   Time will not change that. 
   Cannot.

We haven't talked in months
And it doesn't even bother me
I wish we could take it through but because you're forever in denial
But because you're forever in denial
That will probably never come true
I miss the way we used to be.

You don't think you did anything wrong
But you really did 
I could spend all day being pissed about it
I could blame everyone else
But I don't want to be angry all of the time.

So we will probably continue to not talk
But just so you know,
I'll be okay.

The men in the bar stank of cheap beer, and cheaper cologne. Their skin had aged many years, but their souls (and hair) were stuck forever in the 80's. They sat together, totally alone, and talked of years past that never went quite as they remembered. The girls were prettier, the clothes were cooler, and nothing bad happened.They spoke less like they were talking of memories, and more like they were remembering an old friend. This friend was dead, but none wanted to admit it. They mourned together, dressed in their memories, feeling secretly alone. The dead can do no wrong.Them after inebriation has taken hold, and the sadness soaked away, the future grabbed their attention. The friendship of the past kept its hold, no doubt, but the future was a beacon. The future is mysterious, intriguing, sexy. She wears short skirts to give a glimpse of what holding her close will be like. But she wears a scarf over her mouth, and sunglasses on her eyes. She rarely talks. You want toe rest of her to match her legs, beautiful and perfect, but it rarely does. The men flirt with her constantly, and she constantly throws drinks in their faces, calling them perverts. They keep forgetting. Her legs, her skirts, are amnesiacs. Maybe she'll be nicer this time, maybe she's changed. Maybe if they're better to her, she'll be better to them. And there was always the chance she will be, but it's slim, very slim. If only they had been better to the past while he was still with them.
Some of the men spilled drunkenly over their words to the woman, while others went back to soaking their livers in booze, and their souls in the past. Meanwhile, the present stood alone in the corner. The lucky few who gave him a second glance were glad they did. For these few experienced something truly special: living life instead of just having it.

&ldquo;I have felt love.&rdquo;
I am a Demon Master.
My eyes are the darkest red you would ever see.
My pupils are an even darker red.
My skin is pale red and lumpy.
If you look closely enough, you will see the blood oozing from the various cracks in my skin, which give my demonic appearance a nice touch, if I do say so myself.
Forever levitating, flesh hanging from the edge of stumps where my feet should be normally shown.
In my chest, lies an open hole filled with deadly, venomous snakes.
Sadly, that is where my heart should exist.
But it simply just does not.
I tell you this because I want to tell you a little bit about me that no one in the world could ever tell you.
Now, I believe that if I had a heart, I would be able to thoroughly explain to you better, and understand myself what I am going to tell you now.
I am a Demon Master and my name is Lord Loss.
Unlike any other Demon, I have no interest in mindless, wholeslaughter killing.
I really would much prefer to cause and witness the prolonging of grief and all the sorrow these poor humans have to offer.
I live in my realm of the demonata Universe, in my castle made of webs. But I enjoy spending most of my time in the human Universe. I am the only demon master who is able to travel between the demon universe and the human universe, although I do not entirely know why I can do this, I find it rather pleasurable.
I am known to feed to feed on the sorrow of Humans.
There is nothing more appetizing to me than a funeral filled with many grieving loved ones.
Or bringing slow and painful deaths upon Humans. I am nasty, and cruel.
That is why it's very difficult for me to admit that I fell in Love.
I'm not entirely certain how this happened.
But it started on a very rainy night in Chicago during the late 1930's.
The Great Depression was full of sorrowful souls. But that night I encountered a very sad young lady. Her painfilled cries and muffled sobs had me instantly at her side.
I did not let her see me.
But I made sure I saw her...
I caught myself feeling Breathless, and absolutely entranced.
Never in my long, sorrowfilled immortal life had I ever seen a mortal female so immensely Beautiful. I couldn't help but to actually feel for her sadness.
For the first time in my life, I did not want to feed off and devour her sorrow.
I stood there and wondered of any way I could possibly make her smile, and not seem e as a complete monster. I watched in suspense as she took a deep breath, sniffed a little bit and wiped her tears with her palm.
She sat up straight, and stared right ahead of herself. She was staring at me. Usually, I freely enjoy letting people know of my presence. But I couldn't bring myself to show this beautiful woman my face. I couldn't let her know I was seeing her like that. For a second there, I questioned my magic. I swore it felt as if she was in fact staring at me. Her stare was direct, full of Hatred and sadness. Intensity and determination portrayed out of her eyes.
The passion she portrayed made me feel.
I felt something for her. I knew I did.
As I adored her to a closer extent, I realized a spark. There lay a spark that had been long forgotten in my thoughts.
Realization seeping in, I wished this girl a prosperous and enjoyable life, hung my head low, and returned to my lonely realm of spiderwebs and tortures. That wonderful mortal girl would never love me back.
Not just because I'm a terrible monster, but because I know she already hates me.
The spark I saw in her eyes that night I once saw in a very unfortunate little girl many years in the past. She wore that same stare as I unforgivingly ripped her parents limb from bloody limb.
    This girl whose name I never got the honor of knowing haunts me.
Her beauty haunts me, and her sorrow fills my &ldquo;heart&rdquo; with nightmares.
I do not know why I have told you this.
    I am Lord Loss.
I am a powerful, evil, and cruel Demon Master.
Even though I must kill you now, you know I have Felt love in my sorrowfilled life...

     I don't understand. Why, when we look at the same thing, do I see beauty and you see discomfort? We are made of the same thing, you and I, of thought and warmth, and...a certain rawness, emotion. When we touch fingers, I can feel the same energy course from me into you, and reverberate. When I look into your eyes, I can see my humanity reflected back from deep brown pools.
     So why can I play amongst the snow drifts while you won't even dip your toe in? How can you just stand there and not want to join me as I tilt my head back and stare into the falling snow, my feet starting to lift gently off the ground? Don't you want to fly?
     I don't ask out of exasperation. I just want to understand. I suppose I never will, because I don't think you know either. And there we are again, staring at each other and seeing ourselves. Close though we are, we retain our individuality. And in our differences we have built a home for our future. Because you and I are like summer and winter, eternally entwined, like the roots of a Celtic tree.

    Martin was about to log off to go do something productive when he received an email. It appeared in his inbox and flashed in a rather obnoxious way. He stared, unimpressed, at the subject box. The words were partly cut off because there were so many, but what Martin could see was in all caps, and shouted &ldquo;MARTIN LOOK WHAT I FOUND HOLY—&rdquo;. Martin checked the address, though he already knew who the sender was. Sent by: badnosejob69@hotmail.com. Yep, it was Geoff.
    With a sigh, Martin opened the message. All it contained was a link to another webpage and a really devious-looking smiley face. It appeared that all of Geoff's energy had gone into the lengthy subject bar. Martin took a closer look at the link. He was cautious to click it, remembering the various troll sites Geoff had sent him to in the past. To his surprise, the link appeared to be attached to Craig's list. Still suspicious, Martin clicked it.
    A webpage appeared. It was, sure enough, a listing on Craig's list. And seemed to be advertising a moose. Martin's eyebrows shot off his face and into the atmosphere. They proceeded to enter orbit when he saw that not only was there a moose listed, but it was for free. There was no charge at all.
    &ldquo;No way,&rdquo; he said, his skepticism bringing his surprised facial hair back down to earth. &ldquo;There is just no way that this is real.&rdquo; Thinking of Geoff, he shook his head and said out loud, &ldquo;What a troll.&rdquo;
    Just then, the troll in question began chatting with him. The words in the chatbox were large and loud: &ldquo;MARTIN. MARTIN DID YOU SEE IT? DID YOU SEE THE MOOSE MARTIN.&rdquo;
    He typed up a reply. &ldquo;Yeah, I saw it. That is so fake, dude. I can't believe you fell for that.&rdquo;
    Geoff returned an incredibly pathetic emoticon and said, in more subdued letters, &ldquo;How could you say that? Do you have any idea how long I've wanted my very own pet moose?&rdquo;
    Martin replied quickly. &ldquo;You misspelled that word, right? That's supposed to be mouse, right? You want a pet mouse?&rdquo;
    Geoff's next face was deadpan. &ldquo;No. Moose.&rdquo;
    Martin actually smacked his own forehead at this last message. Typing quickly, he said, &ldquo;Since when have you wanted a moose? This morning?!&rdquo;
    Geoff's emote beamed at Martin. &ldquo;I will name him Elliot.&rdquo;
    Martin rolled his eyes and was about to go offline when he was stopped by Geoff's next message:
    &ldquo;So, your mailing address is 239 Wicket Ave, right?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Oh, well I told them I can't transport the moose myself, so they offered to bring him here. But I live in an apartment, sooo...&rdquo; Geoff trailed off.
    &ldquo;So you told them to bring it HERE?!?!&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Ummm...maybe?&rdquo;
    Martin's doorbell rang at that precise moment. &ldquo;You're dead to me,&rdquo; he told Geoff, and logged off.

   The door of the taxidermist's shop opened, ringing the bell to let the owner know there was a customer inside. In walked a man in his late 30's or early 40's, rather portly and lacking somewhat in the height department for someone of his age, his hair already losing its once vivid hue. A man walked out from a room in the back, an older man with white hair and a white beard, wearing a cap. His store was filled with stuffed critters of every kind.
   &ldquo;Hello, Robert,&rdquo; said the store owner.
   &ldquo;Hello, Chuck,&rdquo; replied the customer.
   &ldquo;What can I help you with today?&rdquo; asked Chuck.
   &ldquo;I have some things I need stuffed,&rdquo; said Robert.
   Chuck replied, &ldquo;Well bring it in, then.&rdquo;
   Robert entered the room once again with his prizes in hand. He laid them down on the counter. 
   &ldquo;What do we have here?&rdquo; asked Chuck.
   &ldquo;Well, I got myself a few rabbits, a beaver, even killed a few coons,&rdquo; replied Robert. Chuck gave him an approving look and a nod.
   &ldquo;So how much will it be to stuff these things?&rdquo; asked Robert.
   &ldquo;Well, generally I would charge a customer $20 a carcass, but since you're a friend I'll do it for 15 bucks a pop.&rdquo; Chuck was always kind to his customers, but he was especially cordial to those he knew well. &ldquo;Step back here with me into the back room and let's get you taken care of.&rdquo;
   Robert was unaccustomed to this, as Chuck had never asked him to come behind the counter before. Nevertheless, he stepped into the back with Chuck and his prizes.
   Chuck pulled out his large skinning knife and set to work, explaining the process to Robert as he went. &ldquo;You see, I have to cut right here in this very spot, otherwise the pelt is compromised and the whole thing is utterly useless.&rdquo;
   Robert at first thought he would be sickened just by the sight of Chuck slashing the animals open, but now that he was behind the scenes, he actually became totally engrossed in the process. He was fascinated by how Chuck worked. He began asking questions every now and then, and eventually he sounded no longer like Robert, but instead like a surgeon's intern on their first day of observation.
   Chuck was just beginning to show Robert how to make a mount for the pelt when a jingling echoed into the room from the front door.
   &ldquo;I'll be right back,&rdquo; said Chuck. He left Robert alone in the back while he went to take care of the customer who had just entered. 
   As Robert had a newfound interest in taxidermy, he got curious and decided to look around in Chuck's workplace. He looked at Chuck's various knives and saws, his mounting supplies, the various chemicals used on the carcasses, but something caught his eye. There was a closet up against a far wall, very small, but it looked like there was a light on under the door. He decided to go check it out. 
   As he placed his hand on the doorknob, he began to smell something unusual. However, since he was, after all, in a taxidermy shop, he decided that it wasn't anything to worry about and disregarded it. 
   Little did he know that by opening the door, he would be uncovering Chuck's darkest secret.

   I had a three year, or more, obsession with Tamagotchis. I don't know why, but I loved the idea of taking care of something small. I always wanted a hamster and never got one, so I guess I exerted that energy onto little video game-like pods that had creatures that needed care. By the end of my long phase, I had five of them. 
   But anywho, I had two of them at one point. I would take them to school and nurture them in class, then after school, I would go home and play with them in the backyard. My old house had a rather large backyard, with three really large and very tall trees. These mystical trees were grown in a certain place, nest to a tall brick wall. The largest one was my favorite, because it was in the corner of the yard with a small space behind it. I would always go back there and pretend I as in a little house. I would take my Tamagotchis out and put them in a little rock nest I made for them. 
   The weird thing about these trees is that quite frequently, they would shed long branches. My dad would clean them up so they were just giant sticks, and place them in a pile next to the garage. I used to take the best sticks from the pile and prop them up om my tree, so it created a little roof from the tree to the brick wall. I had collected so many, that the roof was almost practical.
   So, every day after school, I'd take my virtual pets and play with them I my little house. I was a peaceful child that would create anything I wanted with whatever I could find.

My teeth become dust, 
Biting back the words

That crawl up my throat,
With the intent,
To destroy.
I swallow
It all back;
The taste of metal in my 
Mouth.

And ironically enough,
“I love you”
Was the sweetest.

----------------------

I Love

I love you like a river in my skin; ever flowing and easy.
But I love life like a raging waterfall; the way it crashes
And roars.
And so the choices ahead curl and scream,
And I bound toward the noise
With your calm heart
Dragging behind me.

-----------------------

Igneous Inclinations

Sometimes I feel so much
That magma is practically boiling beneath my tongue.
And I excuse myself;
Letting lava flow free and spew,
And burn no one but myself.
Detached, I sit there until it cools,
And let my mountains form
So that those who wish to get me
Must climb and fight.
And all the while, I continue to attest within
That I burn no one
But myself.

You can’t see the way I look at you
Those deep brown eyes
Captivating me with every glance
They light up when you smile
That smile only you can make look good
That smile which causes mine.
Together, we are infinite.

--------------------------

I am beautiful because you made me this way,
Your love and laughter filled me up 
And put a smile on my face.
Those glowing brown eyes
Gave me confidence,
But suddenly, the beauty faded away.

You took it with you the moment you left
Your love was no longer mine
To hold, to have, to keep.
The gleam in your eyes no longer there.

With you, you took the beauty you gave me,
Soon to be someone else’s.
I only wish the beauty within you
Doesn’t die out.
I only wish you stay beautiful.

Nothing remains, inexorably dead.
All is dust, all is dust.

Cruel iron night ends with break of dawn
Like a brown bear fleeing from a fawn
Leaves’ frost begins to melt
As day’s searing light is felt
Upon the land of only one and one
With joy’s true battle not yet won.
It burns like a blaze, yet is not fire
A kindling flame, not simple pyre
Pain from without, not within
Night’s grasp it is still in
That growing, blooming rose
That does not hide nor strike pose
Which would only taint its perfect red
And leave the heart’s desire not yet fed.

A captive taken away from sleep
The bag that stole me away hangs under my eyes
Making a mask of make up
Counting calories in breakfast, counting 24 defined ribs
7:45 am
Running red lights, running in late
Failing tests, failing classes
Honors, AP, IB
And repeat.
6:10 pm
“How was school?”
Fine.
“How are your grades?”
Fine.
7:45 pm
A computer screen illuminates disappointed faces
B, C, C, D, A, C-, F, B-, A-
“Since you were little, we’ve had such great expectations for you.”
But then I was rubbing my eyes
Blinking back sleep saying,
“Mommy, I don’t want to go to bed.”
And now I’m rubbing my eyes
Blinking back tears
Saying,
“Mom, I’m tired. I’m so, so tired.”

-----------------------------------

The seats reclined
In your Volvo station wagon
It’s 3 am, an irrelevant time
You’re bragging
About your new seat covers
You keep repeating
How much you love them.
	
You’re always amused by life
But I can see the melancholy in your ryes
Tonight, you want to cry
But opening up is the thing you despise.

You’re black and blue
And I wish I could fix you.

---------------------------

I’m a speck
On the world’s green and blue face
A dot so insignificant
Few would notice if I’m gone.

I’m an American
With my life already planned out,
School, work, death

I’m stuck in a cycle
Repeating its turn
Just as the earth does to the sun

I am hopelessly normal.
And it’s terribly sad.

----------------------

I’m feeling uncreative
Writer’s block
Actually, it’s just my mind
I’m unable to focus my thoughts
A blur of moments, words
Like when you first wake up
And your eyes blur unable to collect themselves
My brain is lost in the moment
When lights turn on and it stings your eyes
After being encased in darkness
My lungs ask for more air, I yawn
My hands feel cold, I sit on them
But my mind is asking for things
That I can’t achieve
Tell him how you feel, it says
I can’t
Ignore the mean words it commands
How?
Get off Twitter it pleads
It’s become a habit
Write a creative writing piece, it demands
No.

Missing someone isn’t
how long it has been

or the amount of time since
 you’ve talked.
It’s about that very moment when
you find yourself doing 
something and wishing they
were right there
by your side.

Pen in hand, you stare at the paper,
“Dear Mom and Dad,” you say in a whisper
You sigh and rip the paper up,
Nothing you write is good enough.
You slowly lay on the bed,
“Goodbye,” you say in your head
You calm now and go to sleep,
Never to awake to those who weep.
This selfish solution you chose in the end,
Made many hearts impossible to mend.


Dedicated to Amanda Todd and all who have also thought that suicide was the answer to their problems.
May you rest in paradise.

Senior Year.

As my senior year comes to an end,
I’m troubled.
I should be excited to walk with my class,
But that may not be an option.
My freshman year was horrifying.
The shy side of me took over.
My family wasn’t very supportive,
So I took a wrong turn.
I began to not care about school,
And I missed a lot.
I began to fall behind, until
I finally realized, this was for me, not my family
We’re almost there now, and
I can see the finish.
I guess we’ll see if I make it.

On the cab drive back to childhood
Life flashes before my eyes
With no threat of death

Back then
Life didn’t reach past the edges of the picnic blanket
Only taken as far as the font yard
Serving leftovers from dinner
To be picked apart by ants
Tiny vultures

Back when I had to lift my feet height in the grass
Stepping over back racers
Pigmies
Cottonmouths
And the corn snakes
Polished serpents with jewels for eyes

Back when I named the bobcats in my backyard
And there were scaly eleven footers in the retention pond
Behind Winn-Dixi
When I pulled a kitten out from under the car hood
And reeled in my first shark, too close to the shore
I cast a wary eye on the cow so close to the truck
The even weight of the shotgun
In the crook of my elbow

It’s bad luck to shoot songbirds

Remembering first kisses
Stolen time
White lies that that turned into
Ugly truths

I was raised by the village
In a town where we all knew each other’s secrets
And there was a matter of time before
Those ugly truths were found out

It was a real community
But looking back
With a wider perspective
The people here as narrow
Narrow minds as the alleyways of
This oldest city.

Cheers to Change
                            
Normalcy
Some are drawn to it
Content to follow the dream they are
Told to follow
Act the way they must
To get there

Others throw the map away
Tear it in two
Watch it shrivel and burn as they light it up in flame
And with the smoke disappears the pretense

This is nonconformity
This is isolation
A state of being, where the
Wallflower and the Satan Worshipper
Are the same
In their period of prophet-like separation
From society
They begin to listen, observe
And learn
Learn that maybe what society
Holds as sanctified
Isn’t for them

And that is where new ideas
And fresh perspectives come together
And a new society emerges
Our moral code is updated
And eventually becomes the new “normal”
Maybe for the better
Sometimes for the worse
But that will not stop the world
From remolding itself to fit
The hands of a new generation.

---------------------------------

Clipped Wings

Fat, black flies are buzzing
Around my head
And I have cicadas
In my ears
 
Poe’s Raven sits,
A heavy weight upon my shoulders
As I lose the race against
The sand in my hourglass,
Shattering on top of gravestones
 
And my fingers have become feathers
Whispering the secrets of life
As they gloss over one another
Fluttering and restless to graze the rings around the stars
And taste the cosmos
 
I’ve looted Cupid of his bow long ago
And driven his arrows through my chest
Sewn a dove’s wings onto my back
And tattooed the Psalms into my wrists
 
And I’m craving everything that I have within my grasp
But the bars of my delicate cage are too narrow and too suffocating 
To reach, my feathers cannot unlatch the door
Until the day I grow hands again

---------------------------------

Procrastination

A forced pen is
A plough without a horse

A blank page is the 
White of the Devil’s eyes

Idle ideas are the 
Dead chicks drowned 
In their own yolk

Spoiling the desert
By inviting maggots
To the dinner table

That is the story
Of a writer distracted
By the shiny silverware

----------------------

Published

I write for a dream audience—
An invisible man
Verses, paragraphs, stories.
Untouched
Except to revise
Again and again
For publicity that they will never see.

And in that night, when we thought the world might not return to us,
We hid behind our hands and laughed at what we have become.
Whoever thought this was a good idea?
This wild, fateful, heartbreaking life?
Who are we to mourn our own disappearance?
Time and time again, I wonder to myself why I want so desperately 
To open my eyes each morning,
And then I look and I see the sun rising from behind the hills (come back to us),
The miracle of a hand, the tenacity of laughter, the wafting smell of coffee,
And, well—
It’s not so bad, enough to open my eyes for, at least.
Nevertheless, in the face of my fear, why should I not go?
Too many before, too many now—I loved, I admired, 
Those greater than I—have left, memories fading to shadows,
Burned to ashes, scattered to the skies.
Give me one good reason why I should mourn the world’s death,
Why I should fear my end. 
 I want to let go of that fear like I’ve let go of
Those who have gone, the way I let the feathers 
Of darkness they left behind lift from my palm 
And fly.
And yet—
I am only too glad to see the sun, to hold a hand,
To laugh.
To emerge from behind my palms and greet the unchanged day,
To breathe a sigh of relief that I can do it all again—
Just one more time.

ONE

You might as well give up on your visions of singularity.
I hate to break it to you, but you won’t be the one 
Who changes the world.
Time is a wheel, a circle, cycle, cyclone,
A locked prison cell, and you’ve never held the key.
In one moment, you’ll be the first and last
To ever cry over Visions of Gerard,
And I’ll be the only one who tries to read the moon.
Next—the world will be too big and too small
For us both to exist, together.
Children are dying in Somalia,
My neighbor is dying next door.
All lives fade.
Caring is not an advantage—
Said one man who was lonely,
But never could admit it.
Don’t try to fight me, give up and stay silent.
Go gentle, go graceful, go saintly.
Go to the sea or to the peaks and avoid the cities in between.
There is nothing for you there.
Rush—the sense of wind, the bump of a shoulder.
No one knows you on this street, you woke up in a bed
With white linen sheets and the lump of a breathing body 
Next to you,
And you didn’t know it,
And the world is too big for you,
And nothing is new to you,
And you must give in now.
Now—pluck your heartstrings out and play them,
Your chest open to collect spare change.
I am the girl across the street
And this song isn’t original.

Limbs bound in wraps of morals, candy floss,
Eyes bright and sharp, in fear dart side to side.
At bonds I saw, I couldn’t bear the loss,
I fight, for you, a war of comments snide.
With claws of steel you cut towards the fact,
Beneath the stone would shine a gem of truth,
Or under stage, the key to the last act.
Where matters not, for your unyielding tooth,
Can pierce veils thick, with care remove the shroud.
The gem, once stone, has now become a lens,
Lets stones on shores gain life with secrets loud,
Clear panes to depths, lay bare the whys and whens.
Though hated by some, my sight and thought one,
So truth be found through fact and we are done.

“Be yourself.”
That is the advice
That we are given
While in adolescence
“Be yourself.”
But how is that possible
When we are forced into 
Expectations, normality, reality?
Yet everyone still says,
“Be yourself.”
It is hard to take this advice,
Especially when our lives 
Are planned for us
Until the age of 18.
18 years until you are free to
“Be yourself.”
Even after those 18 years,
College is an expectation.
An extra 4 years
Before you can 
“Be yourself.”
The pressure to get
A good education and 
A good job
Makes it hard to 
“Be yourself.”
You find so many people
Complaining about their jobs.
“I should just quit.”
But even if you quit, who knows if you’ll finally
“Be yourself.”
You waste your life
Fitting into society
And before you know it,
You’ve lost your chance to 
“Be yourself.”

I lay with my eyes closed 
As I spiral into a new creation
I awake into a new world
A world where anything and everything is possible

Everything around me is something 
Of my own mentality
I did not choose to dream this 
It is just my imagination 

There is no stopping 
The inspiration it gives.

-------------------------

We use to be so close
And out of anyone
I miss you the most

I can see the pain in your eyes
When we secretly pass
I try to brush it off with my sighs

We use to talk all day
About anything and everything
And now we have nothing to say.


Where do I go from here
Is there something new near?
When will I know and how?

Is there something more?
Friends, places, food?
How much more can I endure?
Will I stay the same, my mood?

I want something new

Hungry
Bored.
And she was tired
Hungry
Anxious.
I had overheard
Her fretting,
Her English
Weighed down
With the music of Spanish.
She worried
About how her nephews
Might not have clothes
Upon their backs.
And they sifted through the shelves
Looking.
The vouchers allowed them
Only so many
Pairs of winter pants.
The boys seemed nervous.
Worrying they might be judged
In the tiny thrift store.
Her child walked around.
Must have been about three.
Tugging on her mother’s pants
Asking questions
In rapid Spanish
I imagine
“What is this?”
“What is that?”
“Mama, may I have it?”
And with every query,
The mother seemed a little more tired,
A little more worried.
A little more sad. 
The child’s questions,
Were so extremely curious,
Her voice raising an octave.
Perchance she was excited
That she might
Have a coat soon. 

I found it fascinating,
That the highest concentration
Of donations
Was for little girls,
Like the one I was listening to questioning.
Maybe we pity them more
Because when they are that young.
When we cannot judge them,
For whatever actions
That might have landed them in poverty.
There was hardly anything for men.
Perhaps we judge them more,
Acting like tiny
Self-absorbed
Middle class gods.
There wasn’t nearly enough
Clothes for pregnant women.
Perhaps we look down at them
At their inability to plan their families,
We think that they cannot think
We think they do not know.

But it is us who does not know.
We create
Legislation
To keep the poor poorer. 
We play god,
We complain,
We set them up for failure.
Creating a system
Where the rich can get richer.
Building a city
Of sparkling white
On the backs
Of those as poor as dirt.

---------------------------------

Irises remind me
Of the French Bourgeoisie.
Ladies,
Promenading about narrow Parisian avenues
Just before the Franco-Prussian war.
They hide,
Perhaps playing coy,
Behind parasols of petals
And tresses of lacey crinoline. 
Their bustles defying gravity
Sipping dexterously
From delicate glasses
Filled with absinthe.
The murky green liquid
Bringing smiles
To such elusive lips. 
Yet,
They sense a disturbance in the Rhineland.
So they stand
With eerie stillness
Atop leafy green heels
Peering out from behind a veil
That falls so tastefully
From a judiciously placed bonnet. 
They murmur among one another
Using short,
Nippy expressions
Spoken in their native tongs
Which I do not understand
For I speak in the idioms of the enemy.
They foolishly tilt their faces upward
Letting the sun kiss them.
Opening their arms
As if to embrace it.
It is as if they do not know
That Napoleon will fall
As all napoleons do
To the hand of the Prussian Keiser.
It is as if they do not know
That Paris will suffer,
And that they will wilt.
Their lavish purples and golds
Fading to the browns of pauperdom.
Because all good things must
Come to an end
So we giggle,
We laugh at their naivety.
And we pluck them,
Embalming them on the tombstone
Of a fallen soldier.
For now we will let them cry,
Let them gather mourning dew 
Upon pollen powdered faces,
Lamenting the fall of their fatherland,
While we await the descent of ours.

---------------------------------

One of these days,
I will end up
Like Sylvia Plath,
I will decide 
I have had enough of the living.
I will tuck the children into bed,
Kissing their foreheads,
Leaving a film of wine red lipstick.
I will shove my head,
Into an oven
And die. 
Just die.
Yet, I still do not understand,
Why people find it so terrifying,
For it is simply
A ceasing of consciousness.
And death is not much of a change
From how we live now,
Nothing
Is only slightly less
Than the little we use
In the drudgery of modern living.
So, I do not fear it. 
For, right now
I am one in seven-billion souls,
All pondering and speaking
All falling in love
And thinking to themselves 
“How special I am.” 
And all seven-billion of us live
On a tiny blue planet,
A pinprick
Compared even to its mediocre star.
And that star is in a galaxy
Of far grander things,
In a universe
So many billions of light years across,
So vast that is wider than it is old
And we can only see a sphere of light,
Of which we are the center.
And we think we are so special.
So special because,
We have forged languages,
We have waged great wars,
We have set up laws,
Created patronizing societies
Based on a system of the 
“Net gain” of happiness.
And still most fail to see,
That we are just
Self-perpetuating
Sacks of salt water,
Replicating and dying.
Replicating and dying.
So that all of our grandest achievements
Is that we have sped up that process.
So what will it matter?
One head in an oven,
Just one more head in an oven?

---------------------------------

The trench
The trench is dark
Is wet
Is cold
And the rats scuttle across my feet.
In distress I sit
Quoting Hamlet
“Tis better to face the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune…?”
Or
Or, to not.
And I sit on the ground,
Of the trench
I dug myself,
A coward
I refuse to move
For fear
Of a pikelhaube
To spear my abdomen.
“To be or not to be?”
I mutter over and over,
Debating
If it were necessary
To run across no man’s land
To charge the Germans,
Machine gun in hand.
“Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I!”
A can of rotting meat
I cling to.
Something from home,
Something that might be deadly,
I could nearly hear the festering
Of botulism beneath the aluminum.  
Somewhere in Illinois
A bull is being slaughtered,
And a poor Irish boy holds the rifle. 
Somewhere in Kansas,
A man is dying from the Spanish flu,
While a women in New York prepares victory cabbage,
And in the nearest town,
A young girl’s poverty
Has overcome her virtue,
And she mutters gentle “Hail Mary”s in French
As she walks side by side
With an American General. 
I in my trench
And she in a bed,
The war has taken a great toll.
And I hear a rustle,
Beneath the ancient skies of Gaul,
Of beneath which
My ancestors
Fought for 100 years,
I hear a rustle
And turn
Turn to face an old friend
Face distorted 
Behind that wretched mask
All green
And smeared with mud,
Face narrowed into a cylindrical point,
He clasps my shoulder,
With the firmness of a farm boy
A farm boy fallen from grace,
Tossed into this living Hell
He clasps my shoulder.
And the fog rolls in,
Like it did every morning,
But mustard gas
Is tinged a different color
Too fast for me to escape,
I draw a breath
Of wretched air
“To be or not to be? That is the question.”

It never rained in Arei, I was told when I arrived. The plants were artificial. The people, parched. The landscape, barren. Arei’s song rang larghissimo in the bass clef.
One day, I awoke to see blood painting the streets. A massacre. Some lunatic had killed a person from each home. The people cried. The sky cried. 
Sacrifices must be made, I was told. People betrayed. People self-destructed. Arei’s song became discordant, a mess of notes jumbled together. Until the melody, like its people, collapsed inward and died.
We’re stuck in a perpetual cycle of our own destruction, I am told…

Brown slowly encases the red slit. I stare at the wound, afraid to impede the healing process. But then a knife plunges in—hard and cruel. The scab cracks. Blood rushes out at an alarming pace. Horrible. Just horrible. I stitch it, wrap it in gauze, and give it time. It heals. But the knife attacks again, making all my efforts useless.
My smile enlarges; the voice drones.
“You must abide to your duties.”
“You are this family’s future. You’re bound to expectations.”
Always the same lecture, only in a different form.
I know. I understand. Please stop repeating yourself.

The old man’s knees creaked 
as they clanged together
brittle
the lurch of the train
reminded him of those dreams
that gather on the cliff
before waking.

The dreams flit about his head
mocking.

He sometimes would go to the tree where they nested
and touch the trunk, its flaking bark
and in the winter
he would stare through the naked branches at the sky
and wonder where their songs had gone.

Once he had the war cry of a seagull
and knew the paths of the world
but that was youth.

Once he had seen life as a papaya
the color of early morning in still pools after rain
succulent and rich

He had seen it in her eyes
and felt it on her skin
but that was love.

And now his knees played him different songs
and he was, in short, afraid.

He was too a tree
and seasons left him 
in want of new colors.

I learned when I was young
To open every orange with the peel in one piece 
So I could see where I’d been.

I could remind myself that dead ends
Were only circles
And the bottom and the top were only ever a straight line away
And I could always keep moving forward.

You learned when you were young
To look up at the trees
And find comfort in chaos.

Growth and decay,
The exploding highways of shoots
Lanes of brown, grey, and green
The patterns.

We tried to follow our patterns
Until our heels had become our boot soles
And our pockets were empty
And we laid out our pride on our fingertips
To dangle.

But we found the circling dead ends
Led us to each other.
And we planted an orange tree
At the top and the bottom
So we would never forget
Where we came from.

Nights Like These

The city sways.

Nodding sleepless to the pounding headache rhythm.

Tires scrape sideways on twisted frames under the half empty moon.

On nights like these,
The boys chase the girls back to their windowsills
A little too far behind
And the wind wipes the specks of night blue from their eyes.

On nights like these, 
I feel like cacao beans and the lines of an abstract painting, carving me into the grounds left at the bottom of the cup. My life is a comma. A pregnant pause. The gorgeous, hollow ache.

On nights like these,
The sun sprints across the sky, falling heavily on weary limbs.
And the men talk of how domes look like breasts, and women peel the skin from mangoes.
And I remember how I loved him.

On nights like these,
We would run through the city 
We were together the tracks of trains, always careening in the same direction
Almost colliding nebulas
I was in my own galaxy
Watching the streetlight stars dance. 

On nights like these,
We would listen to the music of the lights
Buzzing softly
We were together the conductors of trains, of symphonies. 
Almost colliding harmonies
Never quite finding an ending note.

On nights like these,
I remember how I loved him. 
And love was a long night
Skipping stones across the empty expanse.
Measuring the distance.

I know this a desert because I was told there is a feeling of running out of tears to cry
When everything burns and nothing soothes
And someone said you pretty much don't matter any longer, I scream
My mind can't find the signs that once directed me
When I want the earth to decompose my body
So my face that sometimes only reminds them of fact
When my love and energy is wasted like the empty space that overflows landfills
There is a few short seconds of silence, then screams and burning 
Then there is nothing that isn't empty
 
But I don't ask for moisture to make tears to cry, that just ensures vulnerability
The only thing to argue with the empty is strange music I've never heard
Because that's what I get for sitting in this coffee shop
Hey, the coffee is black sweetness when the people are bitter

Life is a beautiful thing,
All we do is wish to be happy.
Great things come to those who wait,
But to some it’s all about nagging.
I want this, I want that,
Not everything will be given.
If you choose to wait and appreciate,
You’re sure to be happy living.
Great things were made and lives were saved,
But only to those who appreciate.
Cars, airplanes, and phones were made,
To help us realize we made it.
We’ve come too far in life
To waste what we have created.
Big brother, big sister, we are all one family,
You and I must stand aside to help them realize, Earth won’t die.
So we must try to settle our differences
Because life doesn’t last forever.

When I look in the mirror
What do I see
I feel like I’m looking at everything but me
Is it the color of my skin?
Is that why people hold a grudge?
‘Cause everywhere I go I feel like I get judged
People staring, people whispering
I may be big but I have a heart
People chuckling, people gasping
I can only take it for so long
I have a mom with five sons
Working every day to make us happy
Some people consider that a nightmare
But she considers it a blessing
Dropping out of the same high school I go to
To support a family on her own
You would think she would complain but
We never see her moan and groan
Now when I look in the mirror
I see something
It’s not me
But it’s my wonderful family.

Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
Not the imperfections you see everyday.
You think guys will give you the cold shoulder
But in reality they really just wanna say “Hey”.
Without women what would this world be?
Don’t beat yourself up ‘cause you think you’re less.
Without women the world would stop spinning.
Just be the real you and confess
What you see as ugly in a mirror might be beauty to others.
Celebrities are one thing but you are you.
Not all men are pigs and want to get under your covers
Some men might want to know the real you.

Her long hair falling down her shoulders
She smiles at me as she slowly wakes up,
Her face brightens my day like no other
We stay under the blankets as the sun rolls in
Her eyes twinkle like stars on a clear night
Without saying a word she tells me she wouldn’t trade me for the world
I tell her, noting compares to your beauty
She gives me a good morning kiss
I almost lost my breath
We got outta bed
And that was just the beginning

The mic stands in the front of the room. It stands tall and proud, practically daring someone to talk into it.

Say something funny, say something silly.

Say something that means everything to you and will hopefully spark into someone else.

Coffee shop machines whirl while everyone chats. The mic looks lonely, up there all by itself. It only has speakers standing on each side. But it’d rather have a human standing beside.

Say something serious, say something angry.

Say something to inspire someone else to say what they really want to say.

Unbeautiful Snow


Snow falls softly to the ground, creating a blanket for the world.

It’s so white,
So pure,
So beautiful

It falls onto the grass, and roads, and roofs, 
making everything 

white,
and pure,
and beautiful

The roads are covered in snow,
Making them slippery

Tires squeal,
Cars turn,
Head lights flash

Suddenly glass is shattered on the ground and sirens are wailing with the snow slowly turning red

No longer white,
Or pure,
Or beautiful

The red becomes deeper,
And deeper,
And deeper,
Until the world goes black.

The way she walks. The way she talks.
 The way her smile brightens up. Oh how her eyes stalk...
Jesus, why does she mock?
Well, who is this “she” I speak of? She is what I desire, What I dream of.
I cannot let these feelings leak. For I am weak.
To the fact that she is extinct.
When I find her, she’ll have me at her feet... 
Why can we not meet…?
Now I am a believer, but not knowing who you are is bringing on a fever.
 I know she’ll be a leader. And I must admit, I think I need her.
I’ll buy her flowers, and make her smile every hour that I am by her.
Whenever she’s blue, I’ll remind her how I flew, to make her feel new.
The Questions I have are few. 
Other than,
Where are you?

It Will Be Okay

This cold, 
This weary dullness all around me.
It’s suffocating.
It’s dragging on, slowly blurring by.
Burying everyone into an uncomfortable state of desperation for life, 
For feeling.
For something. More…
I feel a slight whisp, a feeling of hope, a feeling of blooming happiness in the near foresight.
The ground beneath me is visible, the sky is a blessing.
My skin is boiling over with the overpowering sensation of weightless sunbeams.
I’m sitting under the protective shade of a blossoming, greening tree.
And Life?
Is all of a sudden okay.

I hate myself for no longer trying.
I have given up on success.
All I care about is out of my reach,
Yet I continue my pursuit.
I know the face all too well.
The face of what I want but cannot have.
All I’ve ever wanted is stability.
But this pathetic teenage world
Denies me that desire.

This new dimension where forsythia springs from every crack in the sidewalk
Where stepping-stones punctuate the grass like a clumsy mosaic
Where pale, strewn blossoms cushion our every footfall
Look, there in the corner:
A neglected throne bathed in dusty sunlight and the petals of a thousand springs
Vernal equinox stretches its greedy fingers and grasps the moment
Slowing the trickle of sand in the divine hourglass to a creeping halt
We can’t see the horizon
But we can still purloin the light
We’ll secret it away while the clock is stopped and we’ll shred our palms doing it, but what do we care?
When summer comes, before the solstice, we’ll break it open, let it seep out into the cool, still night
Rays strike iridescent insects, leaving them frozen in wonder at the thing we cradle in our hands
And this time, our voices entwined in the air, we’ll take the stars.

Sanguine Oracle

The old man on his front porch stinks of starlight and aphorisms
As behind him varnish curls in tatters from the walls of his shanty
Bare as a horned skull bleaching in the sun
He chews on a riddle, a glint in his clouded blue eye
The lifeblood is there, do you hear it?
In the creak of his rocking chair 
Listen for the quiet fortitude of stern-faced gods
Unyielding, omniscient
In each drop of blood staining the red dusk
In each splintering limb of holy wood

-------------------------------

The Violinist

Bowtie askew beneath his strong jaw
Nose like Adonis
He glances askance at the dancers, the strongmen, the
Russian mafia under cover of spotlights,
glitter, and ambiguous movement

There’s a secret in his gaze, cobalt blue through tousled Athenian curls
There’s a mystery hidden behind his teeth
Tucked safe beneath his tongue like the last resort of a stranded Bedouin
Skilled fingers plucking strings, the spark in his eye gives it away

It falls from his mouth in the awkward curtain call 
When his taut smile
Self-aware, self-conscious, self-contained
Breaks
And a new music flows forth in his laugh

Sweetly and softly while embracing you

Though the divine took you from me, it still feels

No one will talk to me about you.
I have no idea who you are.
I have no idea who I am.
The part about you that makes me weep is not knowing
What life would be like with you.

Where are you?
Where have you gone?
Will I ever see you again?
are you really gone forever?

If you were here, would my mother be happy?
Would we live in a home with a dog and three horses?
Would we make dinner every night?
would you teach me how to fish?

Most of all, I will never know to love you.
I will never hear the sound of your voice again.
I will never know the threat of your tongue.
I will never know you.

Palm trees growing across her front courtyard,

Two people walking to the same pace 
A concerto, just once is more than enough,

When I ride the wind and land on your world
A white breeze will surround you.

You ask where I come from
I smile and reply that it’s a secret.

As long as it’s you and me continuing on together.

Heaven is anytime and anyplace.
To me, you are more dazzling than an angel.

A frozen room with frozen smoke.
It stings my eyes, but I can breathe in the muggy air.
No one despises its ways, no one judges its movement.
My mind dances about the lonely room, and I wish there were more of me to comfort it, The love is lost and the lies are abundant.
Its hard to see the truth through the thickening smoke.
It makes me uneasy.
My heart beats slow and fast all at once.
I know by now that the cigarette smoke will lead me.
Flooded with guilt and the strange feeling that I’m in someone else’s body.
The body and spirit will forever be disconnected.
I open my beast-like eyes to observe my surroundings.
A forrest of regret and loss.
Looking into the eyes of the ocean.
It has given me so much already.
Its hard to be grateful when you are filled with overwhelming sorrow.
Yet, the world, greeting the lost souls.
Its hard to believe this whole time, I was asleep; dreaming of a world so distant from ours.
I sit up from the carpet floor and immeadiatly notice something.
“This isn’t even my shirt” I whine.
